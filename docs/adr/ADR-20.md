| -------- | ---------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| 1        | 2026-06-17 | @jeffmccune | Initial design — four illustrative Kinds (`Client`, `ClientRole`, `RealmRole`, `Group`), the ownership boundary vs `keycloak-config-cli`, reserved-name + claim enforcement, and a list of open questions; schemas explicitly "illustrative, not final" |
| 2        | 2026-06-20 | @jeffmccune | Make the `## Design` concrete for the **project group-management use case**. Add the centrally-managed **`Instance`** reference Kind (API URL, `caBundle`, admin `credentialsSecretRef`, `realm`; multiple instances per cluster; in/out-of/remote-cluster targets) and the **`User`** Kind (Admin-API pre-create-if-necessary + first-broker-login auto-link by email). Resolve the open questions: the **claim value** comes from a **client-role** assignment surfaced by the existing `oidc-usermodel-client-role-mapper` (rejecting the full-path Group Membership mapper and a script mapper); **nested groups** `projects/<project>/{roles,custodians}/{owner,editor,viewer}` are idiomatic in Keycloak 26.x; **custodian delegation** uses Fine-Grained Admin Permissions v2 `manage-members`/`manage-membership` group scope (KC ≥ 26.2). Every Kind references a `Instance` and a cross-namespace reference is authorized by a `security.holos.run` `ReferenceGrant` ([ADR-22](ADR-22.md)). State the **API-group dependency boundary** (`api/keycloak/v1alpha1` imports only `k8s.io/api`/`k8s.io/apimachinery`), the **`holos_controller` metrics**, and the **Gateway-API status** contract. Reconciled by the existing `holos-controller` binary as a second API group alongside `quay.holos.run`. Keep `Status: Proposed`, `Updates: ADR-3` |
| 3        | 2026-06-20 | @jeffmccune | **`Status: Partially Implemented`** — the API group **shipped** (HOL-1344..HOL-1348): the `api/keycloak/v1alpha1` types (`Instance`/`Group`/`User`/`Client`), the `internal/keycloak` Admin REST client seam, and the four reconcilers (`internal/controller/keycloak`, claim model + finalizers + conditions + metrics + `ReferenceGrant` gating), with CRDs and RBAC installed by the controller's kustomize tree. Phase 6 (HOL-1348) wired the Holos CUE layer: the controller's **admin credential** (the confidential `svc-holos-controller` service-account client with scoped `realm-management` roles + a generate-once bootstrap into `holos-controller-keycloak-creds`), the realm's **first-broker-login auto-link flow** (`Detect Existing Broker User` + `Automatically Set Existing User`), the central **`Instance`** + `security.holos.run` `ReferenceGrant` (the `keycloak-instance` component), and the **`my-project`** project CRs (the role/custodian `Group`s, the owner `User` `bob@example.com`, and the project `Client`). **Implementation deviations from this ADR's worked examples:** the shipped `Group.spec.clientRoles[]` / `Client.spec.clientRoles[]` (a `{clientRef, role}` referencing a `Client` CR by object name) replaced the proposed `Group.clientRoleBindings` (a bare `clientId` list) + `Client.emitProjectRolesInGroupsClaim` flag, and the `Client` reconciler always ensures its own client-role→`groups` mapper. A consequence: the ADR's **"Quay use case"** (folding `my-project-<role>` into the **platform Quay** client's token with no project client) is **not yet implemented** — the reserved-name guard forbids a tenant `Client` targeting `https://quay.holos.internal` and `clientRef` resolves only a same-namespace CR, so today the `my-project` claim values surface in the **project's own** `https://my-project.holos.internal` client token (the ADR's "project's own service" path). Folding onto the reserved Quay client is tracked as follow-up. `ClientRole`/`RealmRole` remain unimplemented. `Updates: ADR-3` unchanged |
| 4        | 2026-06-21 | @jeffmccune | **Close the "Quay use case" gap (HOL-1350).** Reconcile the implemented `clientRoles` model with this ADR's proposed `clientRoleBindings`/`emitProjectRolesInGroupsClaim` design: `ClientRoleReference` now names its target client by **exactly one of** `clientRef` (a same-namespace `Client` CR, the "project's own service" path) **or `clientId`** (a Keycloak clientId directly — the new field, CEL-enforced mutual exclusion). A `Group` confers a **project-prefixed** client role (`my-project-<role>`) on the **platform-reserved Quay client** (`https://quay.holos.internal`) by naming its `clientId` directly — no tenant `Client` CR exists for it (the reserved-name guard still forbids one). The group reconciler **ensures the project-prefixed role exists** on the named client (idempotent create, on the direct path only — a `clientRef` target stays get-only so a group never expands a project client's role vocabulary), and a **direct-path guard** in `conferClientRoles` bounds the raw-`clientId` capability so it cannot escalate privilege: the target must be on a tight **allowlist of permitted reserved consumer clients** (only the Quay client — so the path cannot reach `realm-management`/`argocd`/`kargo` or an arbitrary client); the path must be a `projects/<project>/roles/<leaf>` role group whose **`<project>` equals the CR's namespace** (the project↔namespace ownership boundary — RBAC governs who creates a CR in a namespace, so a tenant cannot declare another project's path); the role must be **exactly** this role group's own name `<project>-<leaf>` (an exact match, not a prefix, so a prefix collision like project `my` conferring `my-project-owner` is rejected); and the platform's own reserved client-role names (`platform-admin`/`project-admin`) are refused. The guard keys on the **resolved** clientId regardless of which field named it: the Keycloak built-in clients (`realm-management`, `account`, `account-console`, `broker`, `security-admin-console`) are added to the reserved set, and a `clientRef` resolving to **any** reserved client is refused outright — so a tenant cannot craft a same-namespace `Client` whose `spec.clientId` is `realm-management` and confer `realm-admin` through `clientRef` (a reserved client's roles are conferable only via the bounded direct path, which allowlists only the Quay client). The `quay` **client object** stays config-cli's. `Client.spec.clientRoles` is CEL-constrained to forbid `clientId` (a client defines roles on itself), so the shared `ClientRoleReference` type never admits a silently-ignored target there. The role then surfaces in Quay's `groups` claim via the already-deployed `quay-client-roles` mapper, so [ADR-19](ADR-19.md) `syncedTeams[].oidcGroup` membership populates with **no Quay-side or new-mapper change**. The `Client` reserved-name guard (client-object create/reconfigure) is unchanged. The `my-project` role groups now confer the role on **both** the Quay client (`clientId`) and the project client (`clientRef`). `ClientRole`/`RealmRole` remain unimplemented. `Status`/`Updates: ADR-3` unchanged |
| 5        | 2026-06-21 | @jeffmccune | **Record the `esso` enterprise-SSO realm + `holos` OIDC brokering topology (HOL-1366/HOL-1367).** Add the *Two-realm topology: the `esso` enterprise-SSO realm + the `holos` OIDC broker* design section: a **second Keycloak realm `esso`** on the **single** Keycloak instance at `https://auth.holos.internal` (reachable at `https://auth.holos.internal/realms/esso`; the existing `auth.holos.internal` HTTPRoute already covers all realms — no new route) models an **authentication-only** upstream Enterprise SSO IdP, and the `holos` realm **brokers** logins from it via an **OIDC identity provider** (broker **alias `esso`**, `trustEmail: true`, `firstBrokerLoginFlowAlias: "first broker login"`). The broker's confidential **esso client** is named `https://auth.holos.internal/realms/holos` with redirect URI `https://auth.holos.internal/realms/holos/broker/esso/endpoint`. **Authorization stays entirely in the `holos` realm's groups/roles** ([ADR-3](ADR-3.md)) — `esso` authenticates, `holos` authorizes. Introducing the `esso` IdP (and correcting the `holos` realm's first-broker-login flow declaration) is what **completes and fixes** the HOL-1348 auto-link flow that currently fails the keycloak-config Job (`Cannot find stored execution by authenticator 'idp-auto-link'…`) because no IdP is present. **AC #5 provisioning constraint:** the `esso` realm and the `holos` IdP are provisioned by **keycloak-config-cli Jobs + bootstrap Jobs only**, with **no dependency on the `holos-controller` API groups** (`keycloak.holos.run`/`quay.holos.run`), to avoid a fresh-cluster provisioning race. **Ownership shift:** the `holos` realm's `identityProviders[]` move under the **holos realm-config keycloak-config-cli Job** (so the IdP `clientSecret` can be injected at runtime via `$(env:…)`), while the `KeycloakRealmImport` CR keeps owning `enabled`. Update the *reserved names* set to add the `esso` realm, the `esso` IdP broker alias, and the `https://auth.holos.internal/realms/holos` esso client ID, and note the broker alias changed from the placeholder `holos` to `esso`. This revision is a **design record only — no CUE/Go behavior changes**; phases 2–4 (HOL-1368..HOL-1370) implement it. `Status: Partially Implemented`/`Updates: ADR-3` unchanged |
| 6        | 2026-06-21 | @jeffmccune | **Reconcile the `esso` IdP section with the as-built first-broker-login flow (HOL-1371, the cleanup phase).** Revision 5 (a design record) wrote `firstBrokerLoginFlowAlias: "first broker login"` — Keycloak's built-in flow. The as-built (HOL-1369) instead points at a **custom** (`builtIn: false`) flow, alias **`first broker login auto-link`** (subflow `User creation or linking auto-link`), because keycloak-config-cli **refuses to add executions to a built-in flow** — the built-in `User creation or linking` subflow lacks `idp-auto-link`, so importing it throws `Cannot find stored execution by authenticator 'idp-auto-link'`. The *`firstBrokerLoginFlowAlias`* bullet and the design-consequences item now describe the custom flow and why it is required. **Documentation-only consistency correction — no CUE/Go behavior change** (the behavior shipped in HOL-1369); `Status: Partially Implemented`/`Updates: ADR-3` unchanged. New operator runbook `docs/runbooks/esso-keycloak-idp.md` and the `holos/docs/keycloak-clients.md` *esso realm* section document the as-built topology |
| 7        | 2026-06-28 | @jeffmccune | **Make the controller transparent — remove the project-prefix / reserved-name / claim-value-rewriting / disjointness model from the reconcilers (HOL-1420/HOL-1421).** The `keycloak.holos.run` reconcilers now reconcile **exactly** the group `path`, client `clientId`, and client-role names declared in the spec — **adding, stripping, requiring, and refusing nothing on organizational-policy grounds**. HOL-1421 removed from the Go reconcilers (PR #207): the reserved client-ID set (`argocd`/`kargo`/`https://quay.holos.internal`/the Keycloak built-ins/the esso broker client), the reserved group prefixes/names (`platform-*`/`authenticated`/`realm_roles`/…), the reserved client-role names (`platform-admin`/`project-admin`), the `validateDirectClientRole` direct-`clientId` guard (the Quay-only allowlist, the `<project>`-equals-namespace project↔namespace check, the `<project>-<leaf>` exact-match rule, the reserved-role refusal), `projectRoleFromGroupPath`, the `clientRef`-resolves-to-reserved refusal, and the `ReasonReserved` condition. A `Client` may now declare **any** `clientId` (previously-reserved IDs included); a `Group` may declare **any** `spec.path`; a `Group.spec.clientRoles[]` entry may name **any** client by `clientId` and confer **any** role name — the reconciler resolves the client, ensures the role exists (idempotent create), and confers it. Previously-refused specs now enter the **normal claim/adoption flow** (a write when the controller creates/owns the object, a `Conflict` when an unadopted foreign object already holds the name) rather than being rejected on `Reserved` grounds. **What is preserved** (reconciliation/structural invariants, not org policy): the claim/adoption/ownership-conflict model (`spec.adopt`, `status.created`/`status.adopted`, the finalizer + Keycloak-UUID tracking, `ReasonConflict`/`ReasonReleased`) and all `+kubebuilder:validation:XValidation` markers (immutability, the `clientRef` XOR `clientId`, confidential-requires-`secretRef`, a `Client`'s own `clientRoles` may not set `clientId`). The CRDs were diff-clean (the policy lived in Go, not CRD CEL). The superseded design sections below — *Claim value via a client role* (the project-prefix/exact-match rewriting), the reserved-names set in *Ownership / disjointness*, and the reserved-role discussion in *ClientRole and RealmRole* — are marked **historical/removed**, and a new *Transparent contract, migration, and admission-control policy (Rev 7)* section records the new contract, the migration note, and the admission-control pointer. **The recommended home for configuration policy** (naming conventions, reserved prefixes, tenant/platform disjointness) is now Kubernetes **admission control** — a `ValidatingAdmissionPolicy` with CEL and/or a `ValidatingAdmissionWebhook` backed by dedicated policy CRs — authored as a **separate downstream effort** (out of scope for this revision, which documents the contract and points at the mechanism). This is a documentation revision recording HOL-1421's behavior change; `Status: Partially Implemented`/`Updates: ADR-3` unchanged |
| 8        | 2026-06-28 | @jeffmccune | **Add the additive `Client.spec.description` field (HOL-1424..HOL-1427).** `ClientSpec` gains an optional `Description string` (`json:"description,omitempty"`, `+optional`) — free text the reconciler propagates verbatim to the managed Keycloak client's native **Description** attribute. The `internal/keycloak` library carries it on `OIDCClient.Description` (`omitempty`) and `ClientFields.Description` (HOL-1425); the client reconciler sets it in `desiredClient` on create and sends it **unconditionally** (a non-nil pointer to a possibly-empty string) in `updateClient`, so a console-set description is corrected back to the spec on every reconcile and an omitted/empty spec value actively clears it (HOL-1426). Purely additive: no change to `Group`/`Instance`/`User`, and existing `Client` specs that omit `description` reconcile unchanged. The CRD bundle (`config/crd/holos-controller/bases/keycloak.holos.run_clients.yaml`) and `zz_generated.deepcopy.go` were regenerated; the docs (this revision table and [holos/docs/keycloak-clients.md](../../holos/docs/keycloak-clients.md)) record the field (HOL-1427). `Status: Partially Implemented`/`Updates: ADR-3` unchanged |
| 9        | 2026-07-04 | @jeffmccune | **Design-record only: add the first-class `GroupMembership` Kind (HOL-1454).** The new Kind is namespaced, `keycloak.holos.run/v1alpha1`, and RoleBinding-shaped: one `groupRef`, many email members, with per-CR `status.managedMembers` ownership so multiple membership CRs can target the same `Group` without seizing out-of-band members. This records the concrete spec/status shape for the API phase, including `instanceRef`, immutable `groupRef` (`name` plus optional `namespace`), `members[]` (`listType=map`, `listMapKey=email`), Gateway-API conditions, `observedGeneration`, `groupID`, structured `managedMembers`, and the ADR-22 drift-observability timestamps. It records the double-binding authorization model: same-namespace `groupRef` is implicitly authorized, cross-namespace `groupRef` requires a `security.holos.run` `ReferenceGrant` in the **group's namespace**, and missing grants fail closed with `Ready=False` reason `ReferenceNotGranted`. It also splits the delegation planes: Keycloak-console delegation remains FGAP v2 through `Group.spec.custodians[]`, while Kubernetes-API delegation is membership CRs in the group's namespace, with owner write RBAC enabled only after ADR-24's rendered-object protection prerequisite; the HOL-1457 Project component migration will seed project owners into `projects/<name>/custodians/{owner,editor,viewer}` so console-side delegation is live. `User.spec.groups` is deprecated pending removal because HOL-1435 identified self-asserted membership with no double-binding; migration temporarily prunes then re-adds memberships when control-plane specs move from users to membership CRs. No Go, CUE, or CRD behavior changes in this revision; `Status: Partially Implemented`/`Updates: ADR-3` unchanged |
| 10       | 2026-07-04 | @jeffmccune | **Remove the user-side membership path (HOL-1458).** After the HOL-1457 Project component migration renders standing-owner `GroupMembership` CRs, `User` no longer declares or owns group membership. The API removes the former `groups` field and `status.managedGroups`, and the user reconciler drops membership join/prune behavior while retaining create/adopt, first-login IdP-link sync, finalizer/delete, claim-model, status, and ReferenceGrant behavior. Existing clusters must apply the membership-CR migration before rolling out this controller/API version so the seeded owner memberships stay declared under the new Kind. |
| 11       | 2026-07-04 | @jeffmccune | **Implement ADR-22 drift-observability status on shipped Keycloak external-resource Kinds (HOL-1459).** `Instance` now reports validation freshness with `status.lastValidatedTime` only. `Group`, `User`, and `Client` now report `lastValidatedTime`, `lastMutatedTime`, `lastMutationReason`, and `lastDriftTime`, using the shared `MutationReason` enum (`SpecChange` / `DriftRemediation`) and exposing the extended `Validated` printer column. The reconcilers stamp validation only after successful Keycloak verification, stamp mutation only after successful remote changes, return bounded steady-state resyncs, and filter primary watches to generation changes to avoid timestamp hot loops. |
| 12       | 2026-07-07 | @jeffmccune | **Design pointer to ADR-22's Adopt & Preserve contract (HOL-1533).** A later Keycloak implementation revision will add `spec.deletionPolicy` across `Group`, `User`, `Client`, and `GroupMembership`, preserving `Instance` as a read-only validator exemption and keeping `GroupMembership` exempt from `spec.adopt` while still requiring deletion-time preserve/prune semantics. This row records the design dependency only; no Keycloak CRD or reconciler behavior changes in this revision. |
| 13       | 2026-07-07 | @jeffmccune | **Ship deletionPolicy for mutating Keycloak Kinds (HOL-1536).** `Group`, `User`, `Client`, and `GroupMembership` now carry `spec.deletionPolicy` (`Delete` / `Orphan`; omitted preserves provenance defaults). For `Group`/`User`/`Client`, omitted still deletes resources created by the CR and releases adopted resources after pruning controller-added side effects; explicit `Delete` also deletes adopted resources after verifying the pinned Keycloak UUID, and a UUID mismatch releases without deleting the replacement. `GroupMembership` has no `spec.adopt`; omitted and `Delete` remove the managed membership edges, while `Orphan` leaves them untouched. `Orphan` returns before Instance or credential resolution because Keycloak has no remote ownership marker to strip, making it a reliable escape hatch when the backing realm or credential is gone. `Instance` remains the read-only validator exemption. |
| 14       | 2026-07-07 | @jeffmccune | **Document and test the rename/transfer flow (HOL-1537).** The Keycloak group controller tests now cover the full old-CR `deletionPolicy: Orphan` -> new-CR `adopt: true` -> new-CR `deletionPolicy: Delete` path, proving the external group UUID survives the Kubernetes object rename and the new CR can regain UUID-verified delete authority. The external-resource rename runbook documents the same procedure for Group, User, and Client, including `clientRef` cascades and the GroupMembership recreate/orphan caveat. |
| 15       | 2026-07-14 | @jeffmccune | **Rename the shipped Kinds to match Keycloak Admin API resource types (HOL-1557).** `KeycloakGroup`, `KeycloakGroupMembership`, `KeycloakUser`, and `KeycloakClient` become `Group`, `GroupMembership`, `User`, and `Client`, matching Keycloak's `GROUP`, `GROUP_MEMBERSHIP`, `USER`, and `CLIENT` admin-event resource types in Kubernetes CamelCase. `KeycloakInstance` becomes `Instance`; it is the documented exception because it models a controller connection rather than a Keycloak resource type. This pre-release replacement adds no conversion or compatibility aliases, and leaves all spec and status JSON field names unchanged. |

## Context and Problem Statement

The [Holos Controller](ADR-18.md) is the in-cluster controller that fills the
data-plane gaps the upstream Quay and Keycloak operators leave open, so product
engineers get a self-service "docker push to deploy" experience. Its first API
group — `quay.holos.run` — is specified in [ADR-19](ADR-19.md) and is shipped.
This ADR specifies the **second** group the controller owns: a **Keycloak** API
group (`keycloak.holos.run`) for the per-project, tenant-facing identity
primitives a product engineer needs to self-service.

The concrete, motivating use case is **project group management**. A logical
project `my-project` ([ADR-1](archive/ADR-1.md)) needs the GCP-style primitive-role
triad — `owner` / `editor` / `viewer` — expressed as Keycloak groups whose
membership surfaces, in the shared OIDC `groups` claim, as the values
`my-project-owner` / `my-project-editor` / `my-project-viewer`. Those exact claim
values are what [ADR-19](ADR-19.md)'s `Organization.spec.syncedTeams[].oidcGroup`
already binds to Quay teams **by name**. ADR-19 built the Quay (registry) half of
the primitive-role model and explicitly deferred the **Keycloak side — the groups
themselves, their membership custodians, and the per-project OIDC client/role
model — to this ADR**. This revision makes that side concrete.

Today the `holos` realm — its clients, roles, groups, default group membership,
and protocol mappers — is **fully declarative but platform-owned**: it is
authored in CUE and reconciled on every `scripts/apply` by the
`keycloak-config-cli` Job
([holos/components/keycloak/realm-config/buildplan.cue](../../holos/components/keycloak/realm-config/buildplan.cue),
[holos/docs/keycloak-clients.md](../../holos/docs/keycloak-clients.md)). That
mechanism is excellent for the platform's *own* realm configuration, but it is
**not** a per-project, KRM-native self-service path: a product engineer cannot
declare "my project needs owner/editor/viewer groups, a custodian who approves
membership, and an OIDC client that carries those groups into its token" as
Kubernetes custom resources and have it reconciled. [ADR-18](ADR-18.md) names this
gap and explicitly leaves the ownership boundary between this Keycloak API group
and the existing `keycloak-config-cli` Job for **this ADR to resolve**.

Revision 1 of this ADR fixed *what* the controller should own and *why* and
sketched an illustrative schema, but deferred a list of open questions and left
the schemas "illustrative, not final." This Revision 2 **resolves those open
questions** from the planning decisions and the supporting web research, makes the
`## Design` concrete for the group-management use case, and adds the two Kinds the
design turned out to need: a centrally-managed **`Instance`** (the
connection/credential record for one Keycloak target) and a **`User`** (to
pre-provision and auto-link a person by email). The status stays **`Proposed`**:
this is a design record, **no Go or CUE code and no CRD manifests are written**
here — those land in [HOL-1344](https://linear.app/holos-run/issue/HOL-1344) and
later implementation issues.

## References

- [ADR-18 — The Holos Controller and the GitOps Rendered-Manifest Delivery
  Model](ADR-18.md): names the controller, its `holos-controller` namespace, the
  `<group>.holos.run` API-group convention, the controller-wide `caBundle`
  cross-Kind convention (Revision 3), and the AC #7 API-group dependency boundary.
  ADR-18 states the ownership boundary between this Keycloak group and
  `keycloak-config-cli` is **"a question ADR-20 must resolve"**; this revision
  resolves it concretely and ADR-18 carries the forward cross-reference.
- [ADR-19 — Quay API Group CRDs](ADR-19.md): the sibling first group, **shipped**.
  This Keycloak group **mirrors its conventions** — the `caBundle` cross-Kind
  field, the `credentialsSecretRef` defaulting into the `holos-controller`
  namespace, the Gateway-API status model (`Accepted`/`Programmed`/`Ready`,
  `observedGeneration`), and the durable ownership-marker + claim model. Most
  importantly, ADR-19's `Organization.spec.syncedTeams[].oidcGroup` keys on the
  **group-claim names** this group produces — `my-project-owner` and the rest — so
  the two groups meet at those exact strings (ADR-19 *Use case: GCP-style
  primitive roles*). This ADR is the declarative source of those names.
- [ADR-22 — The `security.holos.run` API Group and `ReferenceGrant`](ADR-22.md):
  fixes the cross-namespace-reference convention. A `keycloak.holos.run`
  `Client`/`Group`/`User` (and the role Kinds) in a
  project namespace references a `Instance` in a platform namespace; that
  cross-namespace reference is authorized by a `security.holos.run`
  `ReferenceGrant` placed in the **instance (referent) namespace**. This ADR
  **cites** that grant; it does **not** redefine it. ADR-22 also mandates the
  Gateway-API **status contract** every `holos.run` CR (including these) reports.
- [ADR-3 — Authorization via Kubernetes RBAC and Group Membership](ADR-3.md): the
  platform authorizes via Kubernetes RBAC, mapping **group membership** to access
  through `RoleBinding`/`ClusterRoleBinding` subjects of kind `Group`, with
  **custodians** approving membership requests. ADR-3 explicitly treats group
  **provisioning and custodianship** as an *external* prerequisite — "not
  something the platform implements." This ADR **`Updates: ADR-3`** on exactly
  that point: a controller that creates Keycloak groups and delegates
  custodian-approved membership makes the platform the provisioning mechanism for
  the **identity-system side** of ADR-3's groups, rather than assuming an external
  one. ADR-3's authorization *model* is unchanged — RBAC bindings with `Group`
  subjects, membership a custodian approves; this ADR only changes **who
  provisions the groups and runs the approval**.
- [ADR-1 — Project resource](archive/ADR-1.md) and [ADR-21 — Holos Project/Application
  components](archive/ADR-21.md): the logical Project tenant whose `owner`/`editor`/
  `viewer` primitive roles these groups realize, and the (proposed) CUE components
  that would **emit** these Keycloak CRs alongside the Quay
  [ADR-19](ADR-19.md) resources for each project.
- [holos/docs/keycloak-clients.md](../../holos/docs/keycloak-clients.md): the
  conventional declarative OIDC-client pattern — the `keycloak-config-cli`
  reconciliation mechanism and its apply-gate, **public vs confidential PKCE
  clients** (`argocd`/`kargo` public, `quay` confidential), the runtime
  client-secret bootstrap, the **three protocol mappers that feed the shared
  `groups` claim**, and the realm/client role model. The CRD-driven path here must
  not contradict this; it abstracts over the same realm.
- [holos/components/keycloak/realm-config/buildplan.cue](../../holos/components/keycloak/realm-config/buildplan.cue):
  the authoritative source for how clients, realm roles (`roles.realm`), client
  roles (`roles.client.<clientId>`), groups (`groups`), the `authenticated`
  default group (`defaultGroups: ["/authenticated"]`), realm users, and the three
  `groups`-claim mappers (`oidc-group-membership-mapper` with `full.path: "false"`,
  `oidc-usermodel-realm-role-mapper`, `oidc-usermodel-client-role-mapper`) are
  declared today. The `quay` client's `quay-client-roles` mapper
  (`oidc-usermodel-client-role-mapper`, `usermodel.clientRoleMapping.clientId:
  https://quay.holos.internal`) is the **precedent for the claim-value mechanism**
  this ADR adopts.
- [holos/components/keycloak/instance/buildplan.cue](../../holos/components/keycloak/instance/buildplan.cue):
  the Keycloak server instance. The operator names its Service `keycloak-service`,
  serving HTTPS on `8443` in the `keycloak` namespace (in-cluster URL
  `https://keycloak-service.keycloak.svc:8443`); the external hostname is `auth.holos.internal`.
  The operator generates the bootstrap `keycloak-initial-admin` Secret (keys
  `username`/`password`) the config-cli Job authenticates with. The controller
  needs an **analogous, dedicated** admin credential — documented here, not
  implemented.
- [holos/docs/secret-handling.md](../../holos/docs/secret-handling.md): the
  runtime-secret guardrail — secret material is created at runtime (an
  `ExternalSecret` or a generate-once create-if-absent bootstrap Job) and never
  committed. The `Instance` admin credential and any confidential
  `Client` secret delivered into a project namespace must honor this,
  exactly as the platform's own `quay-oidc` bootstrap does.

### Web research backing the resolved decisions

The open questions are resolved with these findings (validated against Keycloak
26.x, the version line the platform runs — 26.6.3):

- **Native subgroups are idiomatic in Keycloak 26.x.** A group may contain nested
  child groups, addressed by path (`/projects/my-project/roles/owner`). The
  controller models a shallow, fixed hierarchy
  (`projects/<project>/{roles,custodians}/{owner,editor,viewer}`) rather than a
  deep tree — deep nesting is discouraged for performance and legibility, so the
  design keeps it shallow.
- **The Group Membership mapper emits the group *path* or *leaf name* only — it
  cannot synthesize an arbitrary claim value from a path.** With
  `full.path: "false"` the mapper emits the bare leaf (`owner`); with `"true"` it
  emits the full path (`/projects/my-project/roles/owner`). Neither yields the
  desired flat value `my-project-owner`. This is why the claim value is carried by
  a **client role** instead (below).
- **Fine-Grained Admin Permissions v2 (FGAP v2) supports a `manage-members` /
  `manage-membership` permission scoped to a group** (Keycloak ≥ 26.2, May 2025).
  A user granted that scope over a group may add/remove its members **without**
  realm-admin rights — the native mechanism for custodian delegation.
- **First-broker-login auto-link by email** — the `Detect Existing Broker User` +
  `Automatically Set Existing User` authenticators plus the IdP's `Trust Email`
  flag — links a federated login to a **pre-existing** local user with the same
  email instead of creating a duplicate. This is the basis for `User`'s
  pre-provision-then-auto-link behavior.
- **Prior-art CRD operators** (the official `keycloak-realm-operator`, EDP's
  Keycloak operator, RightCrowd's) validate the per-resource-CR-over-Admin-API
  approach this group takes — a Kubernetes CR per Keycloak realm object,
  reconciled through the Keycloak Admin REST API.

## Design

All Kinds below are **namespaced** custom resources in the `keycloak.holos.run/v1alpha1`
API group, reconciled by the existing `holos-controller` binary ([ADR-18](ADR-18.md))
as a **second API group alongside `quay.holos.run`** ([ADR-19](ADR-19.md)) — the
same manager process, a sibling reconciler set, not a new binary. They reach
Keycloak over its **Admin REST API**, authenticated by a per-target credential the
`Instance` Kind holds.

The Kinds are: **`Instance`** (the connection/credential record for one
Keycloak target), **`Client`** (a per-project OIDC client named by its
URL, with the `groups`-claim wiring), **`Group`** (the nested
`roles`/`custodians` group tree and its custodian delegation), **`User`**
(pre-provision-by-email + first-login auto-link), and the role Kinds
**`ClientRole`** / **`RealmRole`** (the client-scoped
`owner`/`editor`/`viewer` triad and the realm-role → client-role mapping). Every
Kind except `Instance` carries an **`instanceRef`** naming the
`Instance` it reconciles against.

### Kind names follow Keycloak resource types (Rev 15)

The `keycloak.holos.run` API group supplies the Keycloak context, so Kind names
do not repeat the `Keycloak` prefix. Kinds that manage Keycloak resources use the
CamelCase form of the corresponding Admin API admin-event resource type:
`Group` for `GROUP`, `GroupMembership` for `GROUP_MEMBERSHIP`, `User` for
`USER`, and `Client` for `CLIENT`. `Instance` is the deliberate exception: it
models the controller's connection and credential target and has no upstream
Keycloak resource type.

These APIs are pre-release. Revision 15 replaces the old Kind names outright;
there are no conversion webhooks, aliases, or migration shims. The rename is
limited to Kubernetes type identity and generated resource names. Existing JSON
field names such as `instanceRef`, `groupRef`, `clientRef`, and all status fields
remain unchanged.

The YAML below is **concrete but still illustrative of the field-level API** — it
fixes the field *shape and semantics*, while the exact field names, optionality,
CEL validation, and printer columns are settled by the CRD-implementation issue
([HOL-1344](https://linear.app/holos-run/issue/HOL-1344)). No Go types
or CRD manifests are written by this ADR.

### API-group dependency boundary (AC #3)

This is the load-bearing structural decision, mirroring [ADR-19](ADR-19.md)'s AC #7
boundary in reverse:

- **`api/keycloak/v1alpha1` imports only `k8s.io/api` and `k8s.io/apimachinery`**
  (for `metav1`). It imports **no** Quay, Kargo, or Argo CD type, and no Keycloak
  client/Go type either — the CRs reach Keycloak **solely** through the credential
  named by a `Instance`'s `credentialsSecretRef`. The API package stays
  extractable into its own module and legible independent of any relying party.
- **OIDC group names consumed by Quay remain data referenced by name.** Where
  [ADR-19](ADR-19.md)'s `Organization.spec.syncedTeams[].oidcGroup` is a plain
  string with no Keycloak import, here the relationship is **symmetric in reverse**:
  this group produces the `my-project-owner` claim value, and the Quay
  Organization consumes it **by name only**. `api/keycloak/v1alpha1` takes **no**
  dependency on `api/quay/v1alpha1`, and `api/quay/v1alpha1` takes none on
  `api/keycloak/v1alpha1`. The two groups meet only at the **group-name string**
  carried in the `groups` claim — never at a Go import.
- **The controller binary may depend on more than the API packages do.** Any
  cross-group coordination lives in `cmd/holos-controller` / `internal/controller`,
  never in `api/keycloak/...`, exactly as [ADR-19](ADR-19.md) confines Quay's
  pipeline coupling to the binary.

### `Instance` — the centrally-managed connection record (AC #4)

A `Instance` holds everything the controller needs to reach **one**
Keycloak target and authenticate to its Admin API. It is **centrally managed** —
created by a platform owner in a platform namespace (e.g. `keycloak`), not by
tenants — and is the single object every other `keycloak.holos.run` Kind
references.

**The name.** `Instance` (not `KeycloakTarget`, `KeycloakConnection`, or
`KeycloakServer`) is chosen because the object models exactly one **running
Keycloak instance + the realm the controller operates within it**: it parallels
the platform's own [Keycloak instance component](../../holos/components/keycloak/instance/buildplan.cue)
(which renders the running server) and reads naturally at the reference site
(`instanceRef: holos-keycloak`). "Server" would over-narrow it to the process;
"Connection"/"Target" would under-state that it also pins the realm. The Kind is a
**reference record**, akin to a kubeconfig context: connection coordinates plus a
credential plus the realm selector.

```yaml
apiVersion: keycloak.holos.run/v1alpha1

| Spec field | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `apiURL` | the Keycloak Admin API base URL (AC #4.7). In-cluster: `https://keycloak-service.keycloak.svc:8443`; out-of-cluster / remote-cluster: any reachable `https` URL (AC #4.2, #4.3). Required. |
| `realm` | the realm the controller operates within for objects referencing this instance. Required. Lets two instances target the same server but different realms. |
| `caBundle` | optional PEM/base64 (`[]byte`) bundle of x509 CA certs trusted **in addition to** the controller pod's system store when reaching `apiURL` — the standardized cross-Kind field (ADR-18 Rev 3 / ADR-19 Rev 5), shared shape and semantics with `quay.holos.run`. Empty/omitted ⇒ system store unchanged (AC #4.6). |
| `credentialsSecretRef` | a `SecretReference` to the Keycloak **admin** credential. Resolved in the **`holos-controller` namespace** by default (the ADR-19 convention, read from `POD_NAMESPACE`), so one operator-managed credential per instance serves every tenant CR that references the instance. See *Admin credential* below. |

**Multiple instances per cluster (AC #4.2), and any target location (AC #4.3).**
Because a `Instance` is a plain namespaced CR carrying its own `apiURL` +
credential + realm, a cluster may hold **several** — e.g. a `pre-prod-keycloak`
and a `prod-keycloak`, or one per realm. The `apiURL` may name an **in-cluster**
Service (`https://keycloak-service.keycloak.svc:8443`), an **out-of-cluster** public endpoint,
or a Keycloak in a **remote cluster** — the controller cares only that the URL is
reachable and the credential authenticates; nothing in the design assumes the
target is co-located.

**Admin credential.** The `credentialsSecretRef` Secret carries the credential the
controller uses for the Keycloak Admin REST API. The bootstrap
`keycloak-initial-admin` Secret the operator mints for `keycloak-config-cli` is
**not** reused — the controller gets its own, least-privileged, dedicated
credential. Two auth shapes are recommended, in order of preference:

1. **A confidential service-account client with `realm-management` roles**
   (preferred). A dedicated OIDC client in the realm with *Service Accounts
   Enabled* and the specific `realm-management` client roles the controller needs
   (`manage-clients`, `manage-users`, `query-groups`/`manage-realm` as scoped to
   the operations below — **not** blanket realm-admin). The Secret carries the
   client ID + client secret; the controller does a `client_credentials` grant.
   This is machine-identity-shaped, rotatable, and scoped.
2. **A realm user with `realm-management` roles** (fallback). A dedicated admin
   user (username + password in the Secret) holding the same `realm-management`
   roles, used with the Admin CLI / direct-grant flow. Simpler to bootstrap but a
   password rather than a client credential.

Either way the credential is **created at runtime and never committed** (the
runtime-secret guardrail, [secret-handling.md](../../holos/docs/secret-handling.md)),
like the platform's `quay-oidc` and the controller's
`holos-controller-quay-creds`. When the Secret or a required key is missing the
reconciler sets `Programmed`/`Ready` `False` (reason `CredentialsNotFound`) and
requeues.

### Every Kind references a `Instance`, gated by a `ReferenceGrant` (AC #4.4, #4.5)

Every `keycloak.holos.run` Kind except `Instance` itself carries an
**`instanceRef`** — the `Instance` it reconciles against:

```yaml
spec:
  instanceRef:
    name: holos-keycloak
    namespace: keycloak          # cross-namespace ⇒ needs a ReferenceGrant
```

A tenant CR lives in the **project namespace** while the `Instance` lives
in a **platform namespace** — a **cross-namespace reference**. Per the guard rail
([ADR-22](ADR-22.md)), that reference is authorized by a `security.holos.run`
`ReferenceGrant` placed **in the instance's (referent) namespace**, declaring
`from` the project namespace's `keycloak.holos.run` Kinds and `to` the
`Instance`. A `Client`/`Group`/`User` whose `instanceRef` crosses
a namespace boundary with **no matching grant** is **rejected** by its reconciler
(`Ready=False`, reason `ReferenceNotGranted` — the as-built reason name; this ADR's
earlier revisions wrote the placeholder `RefNotPermitted`), never silently honored — the same
default-deny posture ADR-22 fixes. This ADR **cites** that grant and does **not**
redefine it; ADR-22 owns the grant's shape. (A same-namespace `instanceRef` — e.g.
a platform-owned CR in the `keycloak` namespace — needs no grant.)

### `Group` — the nested role/custodian group tree (AC #5)

A `Group` manages a project's primitive-role groups as a **shallow nested
group tree** under a per-project parent, plus the **custodian** groups that
delegate membership management:

```text
projects/
  <project>/
    roles/
      owner
      editor
      viewer
    custodians/
      owner
      editor
      viewer
```

`projects/<project>/roles/{owner,editor,viewer}` are the groups a person is a
**member** of to hold the corresponding primitive role.
`projects/<project>/custodians/{owner,editor,viewer}` are the groups whose members
**manage the membership** of the matching `roles/*` group (a custodian of
`custodians/owner` adds/removes members of `roles/owner`).

```yaml
apiVersion: keycloak.holos.run/v1alpha1
kind: Group
metadata:
  name: my-project-roles
  namespace: my-project
spec:
  instanceRef:
    name: holos-keycloak
    namespace: keycloak
  # The logical project this group tree belongs to. The controller creates the
  # shallow nested tree projects/<project>/{roles,custodians}/{owner,editor,viewer}.
  project: my-project
  # The primitive roles to provision (the GCP triad).
  roles: [owner, editor, viewer]
  # AUTHORITATIVE owner of the claim-value binding: which consumer client(s) carry
  # the my-project-<role> client role for each role group, so membership surfaces
  # as the flat groups-claim value in that consumer's token (the mapper is
  # per-client; see "claim value" below). The Quay client https://quay.holos.internal
  # is the consumer for the ADR-19 syncedTeams use case — and it needs NO project
  # Client at all, which is why this binding lives on Group (the
  # owner of the role groups), not on Client. List one or more entries;
  # each names its target client by EXACTLY ONE of clientId (a Keycloak clientId
  # directly — used for the reserved Quay client, project-prefixed roles only) or
  # clientRef (a same-namespace Client CR — a project's own client).
  #
  # IMPLEMENTED SHAPE (HOL-1347/HOL-1350): the field is spec.clientRoles[], a list
  # of {clientId|clientRef, role} — it replaced this ADR's earlier proposed
  # Group.clientRoleBindings (a bare clientId list). The example below uses
  # the implemented field.
  clientRoles:
    - clientId: https://quay.holos.internal   # the ADR-19 syncedTeams consumer
      role: my-project-owner                   # project-prefixed; reserved on this client
  # Custodian delegation: members of custodians/<role> manage membership of
  # roles/<role>, via FGAP v2 manage-members/manage-membership scoped to the
  # roles/<role> group. "controller" is the fallback mechanism (see below).
  custodianDelegation: fgap-v2     # fgap-v2 | controller
status:
  observedGeneration: 1
  # The group paths this CR created and owns (the claim/ownership marker).
  managedGroups:
    - /projects/my-project/roles/owner
    - /projects/my-project/roles/editor
    - /projects/my-project/roles/viewer
    - /projects/my-project/custodians/owner
    - /projects/my-project/custodians/editor
    - /projects/my-project/custodians/viewer
  conditions:
    - type: Accepted
      status: "True"
      reason: Reconciled
    - type: Programmed

      reason: Created
    - type: Ready
      status: "True"
      reason: Created
```

**Nested-groups decision.** Keycloak 26.x treats native subgroups as idiomatic, so
the group tree is modeled as real nested groups (`/projects/<project>/roles/owner`)
rather than flat, name-mangled groups (`projects-my-project-roles-owner`). The
tree is kept **shallow** (three levels: `projects` → `<project>` →
`{roles,custodians}` → leaf) because deep nesting hurts performance and
legibility; the web research confirms shallow nesting is the recommended idiom.
The `authenticated` flat default group ([realm-config buildplan.cue](../../holos/components/keycloak/realm-config/buildplan.cue))
is platform-owned and **untouched** — the nested project tree is additive.

**The bare-leaf-name caveat — why the claim value comes from the client role, not
the group name.** Each client's existing `oidc-group-membership-mapper` runs with
`full.path: "false"`
([realm-config buildplan.cue](../../holos/components/keycloak/realm-config/buildplan.cue)),
which emits the **bare leaf** of *every* group a user belongs to. A member of
`/projects/my-project/roles/owner` therefore also gets a generic **`owner`** value
in the `groups` claim — which would collide across projects if relying parties keyed
on it. This is precisely why the collision-safe primitive-role value is **not** the
group name but the **client role `my-project-owner`** (the *Claim value* section
below): consumers ([ADR-19](ADR-19.md) `syncedTeams[].oidcGroup`, Argo CD RBAC) key
on the **project-prefixed client-role value**, never the bare leaf. The bare leaf
(`owner`/`editor`/`viewer`) is an **accepted, ignored byproduct** of the existing
group-membership mapper — it carries no authority because nothing the platform
binds keys on it. (A future tightening could scope or drop the project subtree from
the group-membership mapper, but that is not required for correctness and is left
out of this design.)

**Custodian delegation — FGAP v2 group scope.** The custodian mechanism is
**Fine-Grained Admin Permissions v2** (`manage-members` / `manage-membership`
permission scoped to a group; Keycloak ≥ 26.2, the platform runs 26.6.3): the
controller grants `custodians/<role>`'s members the `manage-members` scope **over**
`roles/<role>`, so a custodian can add/remove members of the role group **without**
realm-admin rights, directly in Keycloak's account/admin console. This is the
native, in-Keycloak realization of [ADR-3](ADR-3.md)'s custodian-approved
membership — the controller provisions the delegation; the human custodian
performs the approval.

- **Controller-layer alternative.** Where FGAP v2 group scope is unavailable or
  the platform prefers an audit trail in Kubernetes, the controller path is the
  first-class `GroupMembership` Kind in *`GroupMembership` — the
  Kubernetes-API membership binding (Rev 9)* below. It keeps membership changes
  on the Kubernetes API plane: an authorized actor creates or updates a
  membership CR in the group's namespace, Kubernetes RBAC authorizes that write,
  and the controller reconciles the declared members into Keycloak. FGAP v2
  remains the Keycloak-console delegation plane; the membership CR is the
  Kubernetes-API delegation plane.

This is the change that advances the `Updates: ADR-3` boundary: ADR-3's
authorization *model* (RBAC bindings with `Group` subjects, membership a custodian
approves) is unchanged; this ADR makes the platform **provision** the Keycloak
groups and **delegate** the custodian approval rather than assuming an external
identity system does.

### `GroupMembership` — the Kubernetes-API membership binding (Rev 9)

`GroupMembership` is the first-class, namespaced membership-binding Kind
for `keycloak.holos.run/v1alpha1`. It is modeled like a Kubernetes `RoleBinding`:
one target group, many members. Multiple membership CRs may target the same
`Group`; each CR owns only the members it declares and tracks, so it does
not seize memberships created by another CR, by FGAP/console custodians, or by an
operator.

```yaml
apiVersion: keycloak.holos.run/v1alpha1
kind: GroupMembership
metadata:
  name: my-project-roles-owner-members
  namespace: my-project            # the group's namespace: the delegation surface
spec:
  instanceRef:                     # immutable; cross-namespace gated by ReferenceGrant
    name: holos-keycloak
    namespace: keycloak
  groupRef:                        # immutable; cross-namespace gated by ReferenceGrant
    name: my-project-roles-owner
    namespace: my-project          # optional; empty defaults to this CR's namespace
  members:                         # +listType=map, +listMapKey=email
    - email: bob@example.com
status:
  conditions: []                   # Accepted / Programmed / Ready
  observedGeneration: 0
  groupID: <keycloak group UUID>   # UUID-pins prune operations
  managedMembers:                  # +listType=map, +listMapKey=email
    - email: bob@example.com
      userID: <keycloak user UUID>
  lastValidatedTime: "..."         # ADR-22 drift-observability status
  lastMutatedTime: "..."
  lastMutationReason: SpecChange   # SpecChange | DriftRemediation
  lastDriftTime: "..."
```

**Spec shape.**

- **`spec.instanceRef`** is the immutable `Instance` reference, with the
  same cross-namespace `ReferenceGrant` authorization model all other
  `keycloak.holos.run` Kinds use. The membership reconciler also resolves the
  referenced `Group` and requires the group's `spec.instanceRef`, after
  namespace defaulting, to match this value exactly. A mismatch is rejected
  fail-closed (`Ready=False`, reason `InstanceMismatch`) and does not mutate
  Keycloak; membership is never written to an instance different from the one
  that owns the group.
- **`spec.groupRef`** is immutable and names the `Group` whose Keycloak
  group membership is being managed. Its shape is `name` plus optional
  `namespace`; an empty namespace defaults to the membership CR's namespace. A
  same-namespace `groupRef` is implicitly authorized. A cross-namespace `groupRef`
  requires a `security.holos.run` `ReferenceGrant` in the **group's namespace**
  (the referent namespace) whose `from` entry is `group: keycloak.holos.run`,
  `kind: GroupMembership`, and the referrer's namespace, and whose `to`
  entry is `group: keycloak.holos.run`, `kind: Group`, optionally
  narrowed by `name`. No matching grant means fail-closed: the reconciler sets
  `Ready=False` with reason `ReferenceNotGranted` and does not mutate Keycloak.
- **`spec.members[]`** is a map list keyed by `email`. The membership CR never
  creates users; `User` remains the provisioning Kind. A member email
  with no Keycloak user yields `Ready=False` reason `MemberNotFound` (a new
  reason constant) and requeues, while members that do resolve still converge.

**Status shape.** The Kind follows the ADR-22 status contract: standard
`conditions[]` (`Accepted`/`Programmed`/`Ready`), `observedGeneration`, a `Ready`
printer column, and the drift-observability fields for external-resource CRs.
`status.groupID` stores the resolved Keycloak group UUID and
`status.managedMembers[]` is a structured map list keyed by `email`, with each
entry carrying the resolved Keycloak `userID`. The structured list avoids
delimiter parsing and gives prune operations both the declared identity and the
remote UUID they must verify. UUIDs make pruning safe: if a group is deleted and
recreated at the same path with a different UUID, deletion/finalizer cleanup
releases the old membership record untouched rather than removing members from an
unrelated replacement group.

**Reconcile semantics.**

- Reconcile to the desired member set for this CR only. This uses the same
  tracked-set ownership pattern as the earlier user-side implementation: members
  this CR added are tracked in `status.managedMembers`; members dropped from
  `spec.members[]` are pruned only if their stored user UUID still matches and no
  other live
  `GroupMembership` for the same defaulted `groupRef` and matching
  `instanceRef` declares the same email. The peer check is spec-based and
  fail-safe: a peer does not need to have reconciled yet or written
  `status.managedMembers[]` to block removal, because otherwise normal reconcile
  ordering can remove access between the peer's spec write and its first
  successful reconcile. This is required because Keycloak group membership has no
  per-binding owner marker; overlapping membership CRs are allowed, but one CR may
  not remove a member another live CR still desires. Out-of-band memberships and
  memberships owned by other CRs are left alone.
- Deletion uses a finalizer to prune this CR's managed members. If the stored
  `groupID` no longer matches the current group at the same path, the finalizer
  treats the old group as gone and releases its managed set without touching the
  replacement. If another non-deleting membership CR for the same defaulted
  `groupRef` and matching `instanceRef` still declares the same email, deletion
  releases this CR's status entry without removing the Keycloak membership.
- `lastValidatedTime` advances only after a successful remote read and
  verification/remediation. `lastMutatedTime` and `lastMutationReason` are
  updated only when the controller actually adds or removes a member; unchanged
  no-op validation does not count as a mutation. `lastMutationReason:
  DriftRemediation` also sets `lastDriftTime`, per ADR-22.

**Two complementary delegation planes.**

- **Keycloak-console delegation** remains FGAP v2 through
  `Group.spec.custodians[]`: the controller grants
  `custodians/<role>` members the Keycloak-native ability to manage the matching
  `roles/<role>` group directly in the console. The HOL-1457 Project component
  migration will seed project owners into
  `projects/<name>/custodians/{owner,editor,viewer}` so the console-side
  delegation path is live for the generated project scaffold.
- **Kubernetes-API delegation** is `GroupMembership` in the target
  group's namespace. A namespace owner can grant project owners/editor/custodian
  personas RBAC to create/update membership CRs there once ADR-24's
  rendered-object protection policy enables write aggregation. This realizes
  ADR-3's custodian-approved group membership on the Kubernetes API plane while
  keeping the double-binding guard: the writer needs RBAC in the group's
  namespace, and a cross-namespace target still needs a `ReferenceGrant` from
  the group owner.

**Removal of user-side membership.** HOL-1435 identified the security flaw in the
former user-owned membership field: a user CR could self-assert group membership
with no group-owner double binding, so membership was authorized by the user
namespace alone. `GroupMembership` moves the write surface to the
group's namespace and, for cross-namespace targets, adds the referent-owner
`ReferenceGrant`.

The migration is intentionally simple for the pre-production platform. First,
move generated control-plane CUE from user-owned group entries to
`GroupMembership` objects. Then roll out the controller/API version that
removes user-side membership management. Apply ordering matters: render/apply the
CUE migration that creates membership CRs before the API phase removes the user
field, so the old controller prunes its tracked memberships, the membership CRs
re-add the seeded owner memberships, and the edges remain declared under the new
Kind. The rollout gate is explicit: before applying the API/controller version
that removes the user field, every live `User` must have an empty or
absent legacy `status.managedGroups`:

```bash
kubectl get users.keycloak.holos.run -A -o json \
  | jq -e '([.items[] | select(((.status.managedGroups // []) | length) > 0) | "\(.metadata.namespace)/\(.metadata.name)"] | length) == 0'
```

If that check fails, keep the old controller running and re-apply the membership
CR migration until the legacy managed set is empty; this revision deliberately
does not retain a deprecated membership-prune path.

The use case requires that membership in `projects/<project>/roles/owner` surface
in the shared `groups` claim as the **flat value** `my-project-owner` (likewise
editor/viewer), because that is the string [ADR-19](ADR-19.md)'s Quay
`syncedTeams[].oidcGroup` binds to. Keycloak's **Group Membership mapper cannot
synthesize that value**: with `full.path: "false"` it emits the leaf (`owner`);
with `"true"` it emits the path (`/projects/my-project/roles/owner`); neither is
`my-project-owner`.

**Decision — carry the value as a client role on the *client whose token must
carry it*.** The `oidc-usermodel-client-role-mapper` is **per client**: it folds
into the `groups` claim only the roles of the **one** client named by its
`usermodel.clientRoleMapping.clientId`. The platform's precedent mapper —
`quay-client-roles` — is scoped to `usermodel.clientRoleMapping.clientId:
https://quay.holos.internal`
([realm-config buildplan.cue](../../holos/components/keycloak/realm-config/buildplan.cue)),
so it emits **only the Quay client's** client roles into Quay's token. A client
role on a *different* (project) client would surface in **that** client's token,
**not** in Quay's. The mechanism must therefore assign the role on the **client
whose token the consumer reads**:

The **authoritative declaration** of which consumer client each role binds on is a
single field — **`Group.clientRoleBindings`** (it lists one or more
consumer `clientId`s), owned by the `Group` because the group owns the role
groups. A `Client` does **not** own this binding; it only opts **its own**
token in via `emitProjectRolesInGroupsClaim` (ensuring its own mapper). This keeps
one owner for the binding even when, as in the Quay case, **no project
`Client` exists at all**:

- **For the Quay use case** (`syncedTeams[].oidcGroup` reads Quay's token): the
  `Group` lists `clientId: https://quay.holos.internal` in its
  `clientRoles` (the implemented field; see the example above), so each
  `roles/<role>` group is assigned a **client role `my-project-<role>` on the Quay
  client** — the client the existing `quay-client-roles` mapper already serves. A
  member of `roles/owner` thereby holds the `my-project-owner` Quay-client role
  (via Keycloak's group → role assignment), and the already-deployed
  `quay-client-roles` mapper emits `my-project-owner` into Quay's `groups` claim
  with **no Quay-side or new-mapper change** and **no project `Client`**.
  This is the join the "no Quay-side change" consequence rests on, and it is
  **implemented as of HOL-1350** (Revision 4): the group reconciler resolves the
  named `clientId`, ensures the project-prefixed role on it, and assigns it without
  seizing the client object.
- **For a project's own service** (its token must carry its own role): the
  `Group` lists that project `Client`'s `clientId` in
  `clientRoleBindings`, and the `Client` sets
  `emitProjectRolesInGroupsClaim: true` so its reconciler ensures an
  `oidc-usermodel-client-role-mapper` scoped to **its own** `clientId` is present
  (the `quay-client-roles` shape, retargeted) and the role surfaces in **that**
  client's token.

The group is the join point; the client role is the claim value; **which client**
the role lives on is dictated by **which client's token must carry it** — assigning
it on the wrong client is exactly the mistake the per-client mapper scope makes
easy. (Where the platform `quay` client is the consumer, the controller assigns a
*Quay-client* role, which means the controller touches a client-role namespace on
the platform-owned `quay` client. That client role is itself a controller-claimed,
project-prefixed name `my-project-<role>` — distinct from the **reserved**
platform Quay client roles `platform-admin`/`project-admin` — and is governed by
the same per-CR claim model in *Ownership / disjointness* below; the `quay`
*client* object stays config-cli's, only project-prefixed client roles on it are
controller-claimed.)

**Rejected alternatives.**

- **Full-path Group Membership mapper (`full.path: "true"`).** Emits
  `/projects/my-project/roles/owner`, not `my-project-owner` — the consuming Quay
  team would have to bind to the full path, and the platform's relying parties
  (Argo CD RBAC, Quay team sync) already key on bare, flat names. Rejected: wrong
  value shape, and it would fork the claim convention.
- **Script mapper.** A JavaScript protocol mapper *could* compute
  `my-project-owner` from the path, but script mappers are **disabled by default**
  in Keycloak (require the `scripts` feature / a deployed provider), are an
  operational and security liability (arbitrary code in the token pipeline), and
  duplicate logic the client-role mapper already provides. Rejected: avoidable
  attack surface and operational burden for no gain over the client-role path.

The client-role mechanism reuses an **already-deployed mapper** with no new realm
feature, which is why it is preferred.

### `Client` — the per-project OIDC client named by its URL (AC #5)

A `Client` manages one project OIDC client and the `groups`-claim wiring
that carries the project's role groups into that client's tokens. The client is
**named by its URL** — its `clientId` is the service URL (e.g.
`https://quay.holos.internal`), matching the platform's own convention where the
real Quay `clientId` **is** `https://quay.holos.internal`
([realm-config buildplan.cue](../../holos/components/keycloak/realm-config/buildplan.cue),
`QUAY_CLIENT_ID`).

```yaml
apiVersion: keycloak.holos.run/v1alpha1
kind: Client
metadata:
  name: my-app
  namespace: my-project
spec:
  instanceRef:
    name: holos-keycloak
    namespace: keycloak
  # The Keycloak clientId — the service URL (the platform convention; the real
  # quay clientId is itself https://quay.holos.internal).
  clientId: https://my-app.holos.internal
  # public (SPA/CLI, PKCE S256, no secret) | confidential (delivered secret).
  # Mirrors the argocd/kargo (public) vs quay (confidential) distinction in
  # keycloak-clients.md. PKCE S256 is the default; relax only per that guardrail.
  type: confidential

  # the ADR-19 Quay consumer needs no project Client at all.
  emitProjectRolesInGroupsClaim: true
  # For a confidential client, where to deliver the generated secret — a
  # generate-once, create-if-absent Secret per secret-handling.md, never committed.
  secretRef:
    name: my-app-oidc
    key: client_secret
status:
  observedGeneration: 1
  conditions:
    - type: Accepted
      status: "True"
      reason: Reconciled
    - type: Programmed
      status: "True"
      reason: Created

      reason: Created
    - type: SecretDelivered      # confidential clients only
      status: "True"
      reason: SecretDelivered
```

The `Client` reconciler creates the client; when
`emitProjectRolesInGroupsClaim` is set it ensures an
`oidc-usermodel-client-role-mapper` scoped to **this** `clientId` is present (the
`quay-client-roles` precedent) so project roles assigned on this client surface in
its token — but it does **not** own which roles bind where (that is
`Group.clientRoleBindings`). For `type: confidential` it delivers the
generated client secret into the project namespace as runtime-created,
never-committed material ([secret-handling.md](../../holos/docs/secret-handling.md)),
mirroring the platform's `quay-oidc` bootstrap.

### `ClientRole` and `RealmRole` (AC #5)

A `ClientRole` is a single client role scoped to one client; a
`RealmRole` carries a realm role and the **realm-role → client-role**
mapping (a Keycloak composite role) that lets a broad organizational role compose
down onto a service. These are unchanged in intent from Revision 1, now bound to a
`Instance` and made concrete.

> **Note (Revision 7, HOL-1421):** The "disjoint by construction" framing below
> relied on the now-removed project-prefix reservation. The controller no longer
> reserves or rewrites role names. Be precise about what the retained claim model
> covers: the per-CR **claim/`Conflict`** model protects a CR's **own claimed
> Keycloak object** — the group at a `Group.spec.path`, a client, a user.
> It does **not** put a per-role claim boundary around a **directly-referenced**
> client's roles: when a `Group.spec.clientRoles[]` entry names a client by
> `clientId`, the controller **idempotently** ensures that role exists
> (`CreateClientRoleIfNotExists`) and confers it — two CRs naming the same role on
> the same client both succeed (last write wins on the assignment), they do **not**
> arbitrate via `Conflict`. So "two CRs claiming the same role are resolved by
> `Conflict`" holds only for a role defined **on a CR's own claimed client**, not
> for a role created on a foreign client via the direct `clientId` path. (This is
> why the worked example relies on convention — the Project component emitting
> distinct `<name>-<role>` names — not on a controller guarantee.) `ClientRole`
> / `RealmRole` remain unimplemented regardless.

**Single owner of the primitive-role client roles.** To avoid two Kinds claiming
the same client role, ownership is **disjoint by construction**: the
`my-project-<role>` client roles that back the project group-claim model — the
`owner`/`editor`/`viewer` triad on the consumer client — are **created and claimed
solely by `Group`** (it creates each role on every `clientRoleBindings`
client and assigns it to the matching `roles/<role>` group, tracking it in
`status`). A `ClientRole` is the **standalone** Kind for a client role that
is **not** part of a group→claim binding (an ad-hoc, directly-granted role); it
must **not** re-declare a role a `Group` owns (doing so is a `Conflict`
under the same per-CR claim model). The two never co-own a role: the group owns the
primitive triad it surfaces in the claim; `ClientRole` owns roles outside
that flow.

```yaml
apiVersion: keycloak.holos.run/v1alpha1
kind: ClientRole
metadata:
  name: my-app-editor
  namespace: my-project
spec:
  instanceRef: {name: holos-keycloak, namespace: keycloak}
  clientRef: my-app             # the Client this role is scoped to
  role: editor                  # owner | editor | viewer (the primitive triad)
---
apiVersion: keycloak.holos.run/v1alpha1
kind: RealmRole
metadata:
  name: core-services-developer
  namespace: my-project
spec:
  instanceRef: {name: holos-keycloak, namespace: keycloak}
  realmRole: core-services-developer
  # Composite mapping: a person who carries this realm role thereby holds the
  # named client roles (e.g. "my-app editor"), without being named on the client
  # directly. Realized as a Keycloak composite role.
  mapsTo:
    - clientRef: my-app
      role: editor
```

Per the *single owner* rule above, the `my-project-<role>` triad is owned by
`Group`; the standalone `ClientRole` is **only** for ad-hoc,
non-group role grants outside that flow, and `RealmRole` is for the
cross-service "carries a broad role" case. The composite realm-role → client-role
mapping is a **Keycloak composite role** (not a protocol-mapper change), so it
composes with — does not fork — the existing realm-role mapper that folds
realm-role names into `groups`.

### `User` — pre-provision by email + first-login auto-link (AC #5)

A `User` pre-provisions a person **by email** *only if necessary* and can
configure the per-user federated identity link used by the first-login auto-link
flow. It does **not** itself configure the realm or IdP: the **first-login
auto-link** that links the federated login to the pre-created record (rather than
creating a duplicate) is **platform realm/IdP configuration** (see *What the
platform must provide* below) and the CR **assumes is present**. Membership is
managed separately by `GroupMembership`. (**Rev 5 ownership note:** as of
Revision 5 — see *Two-realm topology* below — the `holos` realm's
`identityProviders[]` are owned by the **holos realm-config keycloak-config-cli
Job**, not the `KeycloakRealmImport` CR, which keeps owning only `enabled`; the
first-broker-login *flow* remains realm config, and either way it is **not** a
`keycloak.holos.run` CR's concern.)

```yaml
apiVersion: keycloak.holos.run/v1alpha1
kind: User
metadata:
  name: bob
  namespace: my-project
spec:
  instanceRef:
    name: holos-keycloak
    namespace: keycloak
  # The user's email — the identity key for pre-create AND auto-link.
  email: bob@example.com
  identityProviderLink:
    alias: esso
    userID: bob@example.com
status:
  observedGeneration: 1
  conditions:
    - type: Accepted
      status: "True"
      reason: Reconciled
    - type: Programmed
      status: "True"
      reason: Created            # or Skipped when the user already existed
    - type: Ready
      status: "True"
      reason: Reconciled
```

**What the CR owns.** The `User` reconciler does the **Admin-API
pre-create-if-absent** (a local user with the given email) and, when declared,
the specific federated-identity link for that user. It does not grant access;
membership grants are modeled by `GroupMembership`.

**What the platform realm/IdP config must provide.** The **auto-link behavior is
realm-level first-broker-login flow + identity-provider configuration**, which
stays platform-owned, not per-user CR state — and is **never** a
`keycloak.holos.run` CR's concern. It lives in the **platform realm/IdP
definition** (the `keycloak-config-cli` Job + the `KeycloakRealmImport` CR), with
the field ownership split documented in *Two-realm topology* below: **as of
Revision 5** the `holos` realm's **`identityProviders[]`** (the OIDC broker for
the `esso` realm, including its `trustEmail`/`firstBrokerLoginFlowAlias`) are
owned by the **holos realm-config keycloak-config-cli Job** (so the broker's
`clientSecret` can be injected at runtime via `$(env:…)`), while the
`KeycloakRealmImport` CR keeps owning **`enabled`** — the two paths still avoid
contention because they own disjoint fields
([keycloak-clients.md](../../holos/docs/keycloak-clients.md), the *Keycloak
Configuration as Code* guard rail, updated to match in phases 3/5). The realm's
first-broker-login flow (**`Detect Existing Broker User`** + **`Automatically Set
Existing User`**) and the IdP's **`Trust Email`** setting are therefore configured
by that platform layer — so that when Bob first authenticates through the
federated IdP, Keycloak matches his email to the pre-created record and **links**
it instead of creating a second user. The `User` CR **assumes** this
realm/IdP configuration is present (a documented prerequisite); it does **not**
reconcile the first-broker-login flow or the IdP itself.

**Security tradeoff of email-based auto-link.** Auto-linking on email trusts the
IdP's assertion that the email is verified and owned by the authenticating user —
`Trust Email` **bypasses** Keycloak's own email-verification step. If the upstream
IdP does **not** verify email ownership, an attacker who can assert a victim's
email at that IdP could be auto-linked to the victim's pre-provisioned record (an
account-takeover vector). The mechanism is therefore safe **only** when the
federated IdP is trusted to verify email ownership; the realm config and the
runbook must state that prerequisite explicitly. Pre-create users only when the
platform needs the identity before first login; membership grants are separate
`GroupMembership` resources. The trust assumption is intrinsic to
email-based auto-link.

### Two-realm topology: the `esso` enterprise-SSO realm + the `holos` OIDC broker

The auto-link prerequisite above (`Detect Existing Broker User` +
`Automatically Set Existing User` + `Trust Email`) only completes when there is
an **identity provider** for the federated login to arrive through. In a
production deployment that IdP is the customer's real Enterprise SSO. For
**local development** the platform models that upstream IdP with a **second
Keycloak realm**, `esso`, on the **same** Keycloak instance — so the whole
broker-and-auto-link flow can be exercised end-to-end on a fresh local cluster
with no external dependency. This section records that topology; the CUE/Job
changes that build it land in phases 2–4 (HOL-1368..HOL-1370), not here.

**One Keycloak instance, two realms.** A single Keycloak CR (the
[instance component](../../holos/components/keycloak/instance/buildplan.cue))
serves **both** realms at `https://auth.holos.internal`. The platform realm is
reachable at `https://auth.holos.internal/realms/holos` and the new
enterprise-SSO realm at `https://auth.holos.internal/realms/esso`. The existing
`auth.holos.internal` HTTPRoute already fronts all realms on that host, so **no
new route** is added — the second realm is purely additive realm configuration.

**`esso` is authentication-only.** The `esso` realm models an upstream
Enterprise SSO identity provider. Its sole job is to **authenticate** a person
(e.g. the worked-example user `alice`) and assert a verified email. It carries
**no** authorization state — no project groups, no `owner`/`editor`/`viewer`
roles, no Quay/Argo client roles. All authorization remains in the `holos`
realm's groups and roles ([ADR-3](ADR-3.md)): the `holos` realm authorizes, the
`esso` realm only authenticates. This split is exactly the production model
where the customer's IdP authenticates and the `holos` realm owns authorization.

**The `holos` realm brokers `esso` via an OIDC identity provider.** The `holos`
realm declares an **OIDC identity provider** with **broker alias `esso`** that
points at the `esso` realm's OIDC endpoints. Its key settings:

- **`alias: esso`** — the broker alias that identifies this identity provider in
  the `holos` realm. The IdP selects which first-broker-login flow runs for its
  logins via `firstBrokerLoginFlowAlias` (below); the flow's `idp-auto-link` /
  `idp-create-user-if-unique` executions are flow configuration, not bound to the
  alias. The alias changed from the earlier placeholder `holos` to **`esso`** in
  this revision.
- **`trustEmail: true`** — `esso` is trusted to assert verified email ownership,
  so the broker accepts the asserted email without re-verifying it. This is the
  setting that **enables email-based auto-link** to a pre-provisioned
  `User` (with the *email-based auto-link security tradeoff* documented
  in *User* above — safe only because the upstream `esso` IdP is trusted
  to verify email ownership).
- **`firstBrokerLoginFlowAlias` → a custom auto-link flow** — as built (HOL-1369)
  the broker points at a **custom** (`builtIn: false`) first-broker-login flow,
  alias **`first broker login auto-link`**, **not** Keycloak's built-in
  `first broker login`. The custom flow declares `idp-review-profile` (REQUIRED)
  then a subflow (`first broker login auto-link` → `User creation or linking
  auto-link`) running the HOL-1348 auto-link executions
  (`idp-create-user-if-unique` ALTERNATIVE + `idp-auto-link` ALTERNATIVE). A
  custom flow is required because keycloak-config-cli **refuses to add executions
  to a built-in flow** — the built-in `User creation or linking` subflow has no
  `idp-auto-link` execution, so importing one into it throws `Cannot find stored
  execution by authenticator 'idp-auto-link'` (the failure HOL-1369 fixed). With
  the `esso` IdP present and the custom flow declared, a federated `esso` login
  whose email matches a pre-provisioned `holos` user is **linked** to that user
  rather than creating a duplicate — completing the design HOL-1348 began.

**The confidential `esso` client.** For the `holos` realm to broker to `esso`
over OIDC, the **`esso` realm** hosts a **confidential OIDC client** that the
`holos` broker authenticates as. That client's `clientId` is
**`https://auth.holos.internal/realms/holos`** (it identifies the `holos` realm
as the relying party), and its single redirect URI is the broker callback
**`https://auth.holos.internal/realms/holos/broker/esso/endpoint`** — Keycloak's
canonical `…/broker/<alias>/endpoint` path for the `esso` broker alias. The
client is confidential; its **`clientSecret` is shared** between the `esso`
client definition and the `holos` realm's IdP config and is **generated at
runtime and never committed** (the runtime-secret guardrail,
[secret-handling.md](../../holos/docs/secret-handling.md)).

**This fixes the currently-failing auto-link flow.** Today the `holos` realm's
first-broker-login flow declaration is incomplete/incorrect and no IdP exists to
exercise it, and the keycloak-config Job fails with
`Cannot find stored execution by authenticator 'idp-auto-link'…`. The precise
config-cli/Keycloak cause is diagnosed and fixed in the implementing phases
(HOL-1369), not asserted here; what this ADR records is the **design
resolution**: introducing the `esso` IdP **and correcting the
first-broker-login flow declaration** (phases 2–3) together **complete and fix**
the HOL-1348 auto-link design so the keycloak-config Job goes green and a
federated `esso` login auto-links to its pre-provisioned `holos` user.

**Provisioned by Jobs only — no controller dependency (AC #5).** The `esso`
realm and the `holos` realm's IdP are provisioned **exclusively by
keycloak-config-cli Jobs + bootstrap Jobs** — the same declarative,
config-cli-driven mechanism the platform already uses for its own realm — with
**no dependency on the `holos-controller` API groups** (`keycloak.holos.run` /
`quay.holos.run`). This is load-bearing: the controller and its CRDs are
themselves bootstrapped against the `holos` realm (e.g. the
`svc-holos-controller` admin credential, the `Instance`), so making the
realm/IdP topology depend on the controller would create a **fresh-cluster
provisioning race** — the realm the controller authenticates against could not
be brought up until the controller it depends on was already running. Keeping
the two-realm topology entirely in the config-cli/bootstrap-Job layer breaks
that cycle: the realms and the broker exist before any controller reconcile.

**Ownership shift: config-cli owns the `holos` realm's `identityProviders[]`.**
Per ADR-20 today the `holos` realm-config keycloak-config-cli Job imports
`realm: "holos"` and deliberately carries **no `identity-provider` (or
`enabled`) fields**, which are owned by the `KeycloakRealmImport` CR
([keycloak-clients.md](../../holos/docs/keycloak-clients.md), the *Keycloak
Configuration as Code* guard rail). **This feature shifts that boundary:** the
`holos` realm's **`identityProviders[]`** move under the **holos realm-config
Job's** ownership, so the broker's `clientSecret` can be injected at runtime via
`$(env:…)` substitution (`IMPORT_VARSUBSTITUTION_ENABLED`) the same way the
existing confidential-client secrets are. The `KeycloakRealmImport` CR keeps
owning **`enabled`** (and the realm's existence), so the two reconciliation
paths still do not contend. Phases 3 and 5 (HOL-1369/HOL-1371) update the
AGENTS.md *Keycloak Configuration as Code* guard rail and the
[keycloak-clients.md](../../holos/docs/keycloak-clients.md) note to match this
shift; this ADR records the decision so they have a single source of truth.

### Ownership / disjointness vs `keycloak-config-cli` (AC #6)

> **Superseded in part by Revision 7 (HOL-1421).** The **reserved-platform-names**
> enforcement and the **project-prefix** disjointness mechanism described in this

These CRDs are reconciled by the **existing `holos-controller` binary** as a
**separate API group alongside `quay.holos.run`** — additive to, and **disjoint
from**, the existing `keycloak-config-cli` Job that owns the platform's own realm.
The division of ownership and the disjointness *enforcement* generalize Revision
1's reserved-name + claim discussion into a concrete model:

- **The platform keeps owning its own realm.** The platform clients, the platform
  realm roles, the shared `groups`-claim mappers, the `authenticated` default
  group, and the seeded superuser users remain `keycloak-config-cli`'s; the
  **identity-provider and first-broker-login / IdP flow config** (the auto-link
  prerequisite above) is **platform realm/IdP configuration owned by the
  config-cli / `KeycloakRealmImport` layer, not the CRDs** — and **as of Revision
  5** that ownership is split: the `holos` realm's **`identityProviders[]`** are
  owned by the **holos realm-config keycloak-config-cli Job** (so the broker's
  `clientSecret` can be injected at runtime via `$(env:…)`; see *Two-realm
  topology* above), while the `KeycloakRealmImport` CR keeps owning **`enabled`**.
  (Before Rev 5 config-cli imported `realm: "holos"` with **no**
  `identity-provider` fields and the `KeycloakRealmImport` CR owned the IdP
  fields; Rev 5 moves `identityProviders[]` to config-cli — the two paths still
  do not contend because they own disjoint fields.) Either way the CRDs do
  **not** redeclare or fight over any of these. config-cli's managed-import
  behavior is **no-delete**: realm objects it does not declare are left untouched.
- **The controller owns per-project, tenant-facing objects** reconciled from the
  CRDs above: a project's OIDC clients, its `projects/<project>/{roles,custodians}`
  group tree, its client/realm roles, and its pre-provisioned users.

Keycloak realm objects are a **single global namespace** (one realm has one set of
clients, roles, groups) while these CRDs are **Kubernetes-namespaced** and admit
arbitrary identifiers — so a tenant CR could name a platform object or collide
with another project. `keycloak-config-cli`'s no-delete behavior is **necessary
but not sufficient**: it stops the Job from deleting CR-created objects, but does
nothing to stop a CR from **overwriting** a platform or foreign object. Two
mechanisms enforce disjointness:

- **Reserved platform names.** A CR targeting a platform-owned identifier is
  **rejected** (`Ready=False`, reason `Reserved`), never reconciled. The reserved
  set is keyed on the **actual realm identifiers** the CRDs match against — not
  colloquial names:
  - **client IDs**: `argocd`, `kargo`, **`https://quay.holos.internal`** (the
    real Quay `clientId`, `QUAY_CLIENT_ID`), the legacy disabled `quay` client
    ID — reserving the display string `quay` alone would miss the real client and
    leave a bypass — the **esso broker client `https://auth.holos.internal/realms/holos`**
    (the confidential client the `esso` realm hosts for the `holos` realm's OIDC
    broker; see *Two-realm topology* above) — and the **Keycloak built-in clients**
    `realm-management` (hosts `realm-admin`/`manage-*`, the prime escalation
    target), `account`, `account-console`, `broker`, `security-admin-console`
    (HOL-1350): reserving these stops a tenant `Client`/`Group`
    from defining or conferring roles on Keycloak's own clients;
  - **realm roles**: `platform-owner`, `platform-editor`, `platform-viewer`;
  - **client roles on a platform client**: the `quay` client's own
    `platform-admin`/`project-admin` (a controller-claimed *project-prefixed*
    client role like `my-project-owner` on that same `quay` client is permitted —
    only the platform's own client-role *names* are reserved, so the claim-value
    mechanism above can assign project roles on the consumer client without
    colliding with platform roles);
  - **groups**: `authenticated` (the realm default group);
  - **users**: the seeded superusers `svc-quay-resource-controller` and
    `quay-admin`.
  - **realms**: `holos` (the platform realm these CRs reconcile into) and
    **`esso`** (the enterprise-SSO upstream realm; see *Two-realm topology*
    above) — a tenant CR may not target the `esso` realm via `instanceRef`, and
    the `esso` realm is provisioned only by keycloak-config-cli/bootstrap Jobs,
    never by the controller (HOL-1366/HOL-1367);
  - **identity-provider broker aliases**: **`esso`** (the `holos` realm's OIDC
    broker alias for the upstream `esso` realm; the alias changed from the
    earlier placeholder `holos` to `esso` in this revision). The identity
    providers are owned by the holos realm-config Job / `KeycloakRealmImport`
    CR, not by these CRDs (see *Two-realm topology* above).
  This list tracks [realm-config buildplan.cue](../../holos/components/keycloak/realm-config/buildplan.cue);
  keeping the reserved set in sync with the platform realm config is itself a
  guard rail the implementation issue must wire (e.g. a generated constant), not a
  hand-maintained copy that can drift.
- **A durable per-CR ownership / claim model**, mirroring [ADR-19](ADR-19.md)'s
  Organization claim and its durable server-side marker. The controller stamps a
  durable owner record on each realm object it creates — naming the owning CR
  (its `metadata.uid`) in the object's own free-text metadata where one exists
  (a group/client **attribute**, a role **description**) — and keys
  create/heal/delete on it. On reconcile it acts only on an object it created (or
  one whose marker names this CR), **heals** managed status records if
  a status write was lost, and treats an unmarked or foreign-owned object as a
  **`Conflict`** (`Ready=False`) rather than seizing it. A deterministic
  project-name prefix (`my-project-<role>` client roles, `projects/<project>/...`
  group paths) reduces collisions, but the **claim record — not the prefix — is
  what makes the boundary safe**, exactly as in ADR-19.

Whether the controller eventually **supersedes** config-cli (folding even the
platform's own realm into CRDs) is left as future work; the boundary fixed now is
**disjoint ownership with reserved-name + claim enforcement**. Until a controller
ships these CRDs, **`keycloak-config-cli` remains the sole owner** of all realm
clients, roles, groups, and users.

### Metrics (AC #7)

The controller exposes Keycloak metrics on the **same Prometheus `/metrics`
endpoint** the manager already serves, under the **`holos_controller`** namespace,
**consistent with the existing `quay` pattern**
([internal/controller/quay/metrics.go](../../internal/controller/quay/metrics.go)):

- a **per-Kind reconcile counter** labeled by `kind` (`keycloakinstance` /
  `keycloakclient` / `keycloakgroup` / `keycloakuser` / `keycloakclientrole` /
  `keycloakrealmrole`) and `outcome` (`success` / `error`); and
- a **Keycloak Admin-API request counter** —
  `holos_controller_keycloak_api_requests_total` labeled by `operation` (a fixed,
  low-cardinality set of logical Admin-API verbs: `get_client`, `create_client`,
  `upsert_group`, `assign_group_role`, `get_user`, `create_user`,
  `add_group_member`, …) and `outcome` — the Keycloak analog of the existing
  `quay_api_requests_total`.

**Registration — share the reconcile collector, do not re-register it.** The
existing `holos_controller_reconcile_total` collector is defined **once** as a
package-private `CounterVec` in `internal/controller/quay/metrics.go` and
registered into controller-runtime's `metrics.Registry` via that package's `init`.
A second package (the Keycloak controller) **must not** define and register another
collector with the **same** `Namespace`/`Name` — Prometheus `MustRegister` panics
on a duplicate, which is exactly the failure mode the `quay` package's own comment
calls out. The implementation issue therefore **promotes the cross-Kind reconcile
counter into a shared controller metrics package** (e.g. `internal/controller/metrics`)
that **both** the `quay` and `keycloak` reconcilers import and increment with their
own `kind` label, registered there exactly once. The Keycloak-specific
`keycloak_api_requests_total` (a distinct metric name, no collision) stays in the
Keycloak package and registers via its own `init`, mirroring Quay's
`quay_api_requests_total`. Label cardinality stays bounded (kind, operation, and
outcome are all fixed small sets, none derived from user input), and all
collectors register into controller-runtime's `metrics.Registry` so they serve on
the manager's `/metrics` endpoint with no separate wiring in `main.go`.

### Status reporting (AC #8)

**Every Kind** in this group reports rich status following the Gateway-API model
mandated for all `holos.run` CRs ([ADR-22](ADR-22.md) guard rail; the
[ADR-19](ADR-19.md) precedent):

- a **`status.conditions[]`** slice of standard `metav1.Condition` (`+listType=map`,
  `+listMapKey=type`, merge-patch on `type`) with the standard **`Accepted`** (the
  spec was understood and claimed), **`Programmed`** (the desired state was written
  into Keycloak), and **`Ready`** (fully provisioned and usable) types, plus
  Kind-specific extras where useful (e.g. `Client`'s `SecretDelivered`,
  analogous to Repository's `WebhookConfigured`);
- a **`status.observedGeneration`** recording the last `spec` generation
  reconciled; and
- the ADR-22 drift-observability timestamps for external-resource freshness:
  `Instance` carries `lastValidatedTime` only, while
  `Group`, `User`, `Client`, and
  `GroupMembership` carry `lastValidatedTime`, `lastMutatedTime`,
  `lastMutationReason`, and `lastDriftTime`; and
- printer columns surfacing `Ready` and the extended `Validated` timestamp.

The condition **types** and **reasons** (`Created`, `Adopted`, `Conflict`,
`ReferenceNotGranted`, `CredentialsNotFound`, `KeycloakError`, …) are
defined **once** in a shared constants file in the Keycloak controller package
(the analog of `internal/controller/quay/conditions.go`) and shared by every
reconciler, never re-derived per Kind. (The `Reserved` reason listed in earlier
revisions was **removed in Revision 7 (HOL-1421)** along with the reserved-name
policy; see *Transparent contract, migration, and admission-control policy
(Rev 7)*.) A denied cross-namespace `instanceRef`
(missing `ReferenceGrant`) surfaces as `Ready=False` reason `ReferenceNotGranted`,
which is the observability ADR-22's grant model depends on.

### Transparent contract, migration, and admission-control policy (Rev 7)

**Revision 7 (HOL-1420/HOL-1421) makes the `keycloak.holos.run` reconcilers
transparent.** The model in *Claim value via a client role* and *Ownership /
disjointness* above — project-prefixed role rewriting, the reserved-name sets,
the `validateDirectClientRole` direct-`clientId` guard, and the project↔namespace
disjointness check — was **enforcement of organizational policy in Go**. Those
sections are now **historical**; this section records the contract as built.

**The transparent contract.**

- The reconciler writes the group `path`, the client `clientId`, and client-role
  names **verbatim** — exactly as declared in the spec. Nothing is added,
  stripped, or required, and **no client ID or role name is reserved or refused**
  by the controller on policy grounds.
- A `Client` may declare **any** `spec.clientId`, including
  previously-reserved IDs (`argocd`, `kargo`, `realm-management`,
  `https://quay.holos.internal`, the Keycloak built-in clients, the esso broker
  client). A `Group` may declare **any** `spec.path`, including
  previously-reserved paths/prefixes (`platform-*`, `authenticated`,
  `realm_roles`, `default-roles-holos`).
- A `Group.spec.clientRoles[]` entry may name **any** client by
  `clientId` and confer **any** role name — there is no Quay-only allowlist, no
  `<project>-<leaf>` exact-match rule, no reserved-role-name refusal, and no
  `project == namespace` check. The reconciler resolves the client, ensures the
  named role exists (idempotent create), and confers it.
- **What is preserved** is *reconciliation correctness*, not policy: the
  claim/adoption/ownership-conflict model (`spec.adopt`, `status.created`/
  `status.adopted`, the finalizer + Keycloak-UUID tracking, `ReasonConflict`,
  adopted-release `ReasonReleased`) and all the structural CEL validation markers
  (immutability, `clientRef` XOR `clientId`, confidential-requires-`secretRef`, a
  `Client`'s own `clientRoles` may not set `clientId`).

**Where configuration policy lives now.** Naming conventions, reserved prefixes,
and tenant/platform disjointness are **organizational policy**, not reconciler
mechanics — so they move to Kubernetes **admission control**, evaluated at
`CREATE`/`UPDATE` admission before an object is ever persisted:

- A **`ValidatingAdmissionPolicy`** (built-in, CEL-based, no extra deployment)
  for the rules that are expressible as CEL over the incoming object — e.g.
  "a `Group.spec.path` in a tenant namespace must start with
  `projects/<that-namespace>/`", or "a tenant `Client.spec.clientId`
  may not be one of {`argocd`, `kargo`, `https://quay.holos.internal`, …}".
- A **`ValidatingAdmissionWebhook` backed by dedicated policy CRs** for rules
  that need state the admission request alone does not carry (cross-object
  disjointness, a centrally-managed reserved-name registry, per-tenant
  allow/deny lists).

**Defining the concrete policies is a separate, downstream effort** — this
revision documents the contract and points at the mechanism; it does **not**
author any `ValidatingAdmissionPolicy`, webhook, or policy CR. The reserved-name
inventory in *Ownership / disjointness* above is the natural starting point for
that work.

**Migration note (existing clusters that relied on the Rev 1–6 behavior).**

- **No CRD/schema change and no data migration.** The removed policy lived in the
  Go reconcilers, not in CRD CEL, so existing CRDs and existing objects are
  unaffected; the controller simply stops rejecting specs it used to refuse.
- **Previously-refused specs now enter the normal claim/adoption flow.** Any
  `Client` / `Group` that was being held `Ready=False` with reason
  `Reserved` (a reserved client ID, a reserved group path/prefix, a
  non-allowlisted direct `clientId`, a non-`<project>-<leaf>` role, or a
  `clientRef` resolving to a reserved client) is, after upgrading to the
  transparent controller, **no longer rejected**. Distinguish the two sides of
  what then happens:
  - **The CR's own claimed object** (the group at `spec.path`, the client, the
    user) goes through the retained **claim/adoption** model: the controller
    writes the spec verbatim when it creates or already owns the object, and
    surfaces **`Conflict`** (not a write, not a seizure) when an **unadopted,
    foreign** object already holds that name unless `spec.adopt` is set.
  - **A directly-referenced client's role** named via a
    `Group.spec.clientRoles[]` `clientId` entry is **not** behind that
    per-role claim boundary: once the group is owned/reconciled, the controller
    **idempotently** ensures the named role on the referenced client and assigns
    it — so a formerly-refused direct-`clientId` grant (e.g. a `<role>` on
    `https://quay.holos.internal`) will now create/confer that role on a client
    it does not own. This is the side effect operators most need to anticipate.

  The net change is that a name is no longer **refused outright** on policy
  grounds — so a write that was previously a no-op rejection can now reach
  Keycloak. Operators with such objects should
  review them **before upgrading**, since a name that used to be a guaranteed
  rejection may now resolve to a real Keycloak write or an adoption conflict.
- **Re-establish policy via admission control if you want it.** Nothing in the
  controller now prevents a tenant CR from naming a platform client/role or
  another project's path. If your cluster depended on the controller for that
  protection, **install an admission policy** (per the pointer above) to restore
  it; until then, RBAC on who may create `keycloak.holos.run` CRs in which
  namespace is the only remaining boundary.
- **The Project/Application components are unchanged.** They already emit only the
  conventional `<name>-<role>` / bare-leaf names against the conventional clients,
  so their rendered output and runtime behavior are identical before and after —
  the change only widens what a hand-authored CR is *permitted* to do.

## Decision

1. **The existing `holos-controller` binary ([ADR-18](ADR-18.md)) owns a second
   API group, `keycloak.holos.run/v1alpha1`,** reconciled as a **sibling reconciler
   set alongside `quay.holos.run`** ([ADR-19](ADR-19.md)) — not a new binary —
   against the Keycloak Admin REST API. Its Kinds are **`Instance`**,
   **`Client`**, **`Group`**, **`User`**,
   **`GroupMembership`**, **`ClientRole`**, and
   **`RealmRole`**.
2. **`Instance` is the centrally-managed connection/credential record** for
   one Keycloak target: `apiURL` (the Admin API URL, in/out-of/remote-cluster),
   `realm`, a `caBundle` (the controller-wide cross-Kind trust-anchor convention),
   and an admin `credentialsSecretRef` defaulting into the `holos-controller`
   namespace (recommended auth: a confidential service-account client with scoped
   `realm-management` roles, or a realm user with the same). **Multiple instances
   per cluster** are supported. The name `Instance` is chosen because the
   object models one running instance + the realm the controller operates within.
3. **Every other Kind references a `Instance` via `instanceRef`**, and a
   **cross-namespace** `instanceRef` is authorized by a `security.holos.run`
   `ReferenceGrant` in the instance's (referent) namespace
   ([ADR-22](ADR-22.md), cited not redefined); an ungranted cross-namespace
   reference is rejected (`Ready=False`, `ReferenceNotGranted` — the as-built reason
   name; earlier revisions wrote `RefNotPermitted`), never silently honored.
4. **`Group` manages a shallow nested group tree**
   `projects/<project>/roles/{owner,editor,viewer}` and
   `projects/<project>/custodians/{owner,editor,viewer}` (native subgroups are
   idiomatic in Keycloak 26.x; kept shallow). **Custodian delegation uses FGAP v2
   `manage-members`/`manage-membership` group scope** (Keycloak ≥ 26.2; platform
   runs 26.6.3) so `custodians/<role>` members manage `roles/<role>` membership in
   Keycloak directly. The `controller`-layer alternative is the Rev 9
   `GroupMembership` Kind: membership CRs are written in the target
   group's namespace under Kubernetes RBAC, then reconciled into Keycloak. This is
   the concrete realization of the `Updates: ADR-3` change — the platform now
   provisions the groups and delegates the custodian approval; ADR-3's RBAC
   authorization model is unchanged.
5. **The role-group's `groups`-claim value is carried by a client role on the
   client whose token must carry it**: because the `oidc-usermodel-client-role-mapper`
   is **per client**, each `roles/<role>` group is assigned the `my-project-<role>`
   client role on the **consumer's** client — the **Quay client
   `https://quay.holos.internal`** for the [ADR-19](ADR-19.md) `syncedTeams` case,
   whose existing `quay-client-roles` mapper already emits client roles into Quay's
   `groups` claim — or on the project's own client when its own token must carry the
   value. Assigning the role on the wrong client (e.g. only on the project client
   when Quay is the consumer) would **not** surface it in Quay's token. The
   **full-path Group Membership mapper** (emits a path, not the flat value) and a
   **script mapper** (disabled by default, an avoidable security/operational
   liability) are **rejected**.
6. **`Client` manages a per-project OIDC client named by its URL**
   (`clientId: https://my-app.holos.internal`, the platform convention), opts its
   own token into carrying project roles via `emitProjectRolesInGroupsClaim` (the
   per-client mapper on **its own** `clientId`) — while the **authoritative
   role→consumer-client binding is `Group.clientRoleBindings`**, a single
   owning field that works even when the consumer (the Quay client) has no project
   `Client` — and delivers a confidential client's secret into the
   project namespace as runtime-created, never-committed material.
   **`User` pre-provisions a person by email only-if-necessary** and can
   manage that user's federated-identity link; the **first-login auto-link**
   (`Detect Existing Broker User` +
   `Automatically Set Existing User` + `Trust Email`) is **platform realm/IdP config
   the config-cli / `KeycloakRealmImport` layer owns** (per Decision #10 / Rev 5
   the `holos` realm's `identityProviders[]` are owned by the holos realm-config
   keycloak-config-cli Job and the `KeycloakRealmImport` CR keeps `enabled`), not
   CR state — with the documented email-based-auto-link security tradeoff.
   Membership belongs on `GroupMembership`, whose group-namespace write
   surface and cross-namespace `groupRef` `ReferenceGrant` provide the missing
   double binding.
   `ClientRole`/`RealmRole` carry the client-scoped triad and the
   realm-role → client-role composite.
7. **The API-group dependency boundary holds (AC #3):** `api/keycloak/v1alpha1`
   imports **only** `k8s.io/api` / `k8s.io/apimachinery`; it reaches Keycloak
   solely via the `Instance` credential and takes **no** dependency on
   Quay/Kargo/Argo CD or their types. The OIDC group names Quay consumes
   (`syncedTeams`) remain **data referenced by name** — the two groups meet only at
   the claim-name string, preserving [ADR-19](ADR-19.md)'s boundary in reverse.
8. **Disjoint ownership from the platform realm config is enforced**, not assumed:
   *(**Revision 7 (HOL-1421) update:** the reserved-name half of this enforcement
   was **removed from the controller** — it is now transparent. The durable
   per-CR ownership/claim model is retained; reserved names / prefixes /
   disjointness move to admission control, a downstream effort. See *Transparent
   contract, migration, and admission-control policy (Rev 7)*. The original text
   below is historical.)*
   `keycloak-config-cli` keeps owning the platform's own realm objects (clients,
   roles, the `authenticated` group, the superusers) — and, **as of Rev 5
   (Decision #10)**, the `holos` realm's `identityProviders[]` too — while the
   `KeycloakRealmImport` CR owns `enabled` (and, before Rev 5, the IdP fields the
   realm-config Job now owns); the controller owns per-project objects.
   Enforcement is **reserved platform names** (the real
   identifiers: `argocd`/`kargo`/`https://quay.holos.internal` + legacy `quay`
   client IDs, `platform-owner/editor/viewer` realm roles, `authenticated` group,
   `svc-quay-resource-controller`/`quay-admin` users) plus a **durable per-CR
   ownership/claim model** (mirroring [ADR-19](ADR-19.md)); no-delete alone is not
   sufficient. The controller exposes **`holos_controller`** per-Kind reconcile and
   Keycloak Admin-API request **metrics** (the `quay/metrics.go` pattern), and every
   Kind reports the Gateway-API **status** contract (`Accepted`/`Programmed`/`Ready`
   + `observedGeneration` + a `Ready` printer column).
9. **This is a design record only — `Status: Proposed`, no Go or CRD code.** The
   YAML is concrete-but-illustrative of the field-level API; the Go types, CRD
   manifests, and reconcilers land in
   [HOL-1344](https://linear.app/holos-run/issue/HOL-1344) and later issues.
10. **A second `esso` realm models the upstream enterprise IdP for local dev,
    brokered by the `holos` realm over OIDC (HOL-1366/HOL-1367).** One Keycloak
    instance serves both `holos` and `esso` at `https://auth.holos.internal`
    (`esso` at `…/realms/esso`; no new HTTPRoute). The `esso` realm is
    **authentication-only**; **all authorization stays in the `holos` realm's
    groups/roles** ([ADR-3](ADR-3.md)). The `holos` realm brokers `esso` via an
    **OIDC identity provider** with **alias `esso`**, `trustEmail: true`, and
    `firstBrokerLoginFlowAlias` pointing at a **custom** auto-link flow (`first
    broker login auto-link`, as built in HOL-1369 — see *The `esso` identity
    provider* above for why a custom flow rather than the built-in is required);
    the `esso` realm hosts the
    broker's **confidential client** `https://auth.holos.internal/realms/holos`
    with redirect URI
    `https://auth.holos.internal/realms/holos/broker/esso/endpoint` and a
    runtime-generated, shared `clientSecret`. Introducing this IdP (and
    correcting the flow declaration) **completes and fixes** the HOL-1348
    auto-link flow that otherwise fails the keycloak-config Job
    (`Cannot find stored execution by authenticator 'idp-auto-link'…`). The
    `esso` realm and the `holos` IdP are provisioned by **keycloak-config-cli +
    bootstrap Jobs only, with no dependency on the `holos-controller` API
    groups** (`keycloak.holos.run`/`quay.holos.run`), to avoid a fresh-cluster
    provisioning race. The **`holos` realm's `identityProviders[]` shift to the
    holos realm-config Job's ownership** (runtime `$(env:…)` secret injection)
    while the `KeycloakRealmImport` CR keeps owning `enabled`. This decision is a
    **design record only**; phases 2–4 (HOL-1368..HOL-1370) implement it.

## Consequences

- **The Keycloak (identity) half of the GCP-style primitive-role model is now
  designed.** [ADR-19](ADR-19.md) built the Quay (registry) half and deferred the
  Keycloak side to this ADR; this revision specifies the groups
  (`projects/<project>/roles/{owner,editor,viewer}`), the custodian delegation, and
  the client-role mechanism that surfaces `my-project-{owner,editor,viewer}` in the
  `groups` claim. The two halves meet at those exact claim-name strings — no
  cross-group Go import — and because the value is carried by a client role on the
  **Quay client** (the one whose already-deployed `quay-client-roles` mapper feeds
  Quay's token), once these CRDs ship ADR-19's `syncedTeams` binds the Keycloak
  groups to Quay teams with **no Quay-side or new-mapper change**.
- **A second controller API group, sharing the binary and conventions.** The
  controller gains a sibling reconciler set, reusing ADR-19's `caBundle`,
  `credentialsSecretRef`, claim-model, status, and metrics conventions — so the
  cost is incremental reconciler code, not new infrastructure. The status stays
  `Proposed`; nothing changes operationally until the CRDs ship and a
  `Instance` + its admin credential are provisioned.
- **A new, security-sensitive admin credential.** A controller that mints clients,
  delivers confidential secrets into project namespaces, provisions groups, and
  pre-creates/auto-links users holds a high-privilege Keycloak Admin-API
  credential — analogous to the load-bearing Quay superuser token
  ([ADR-19](ADR-19.md)). The recommendation is a **scoped** `realm-management`
  service-account client (not blanket realm-admin), created at runtime and never
  committed. *(As of Revision 7 (HOL-1421) the controller no longer enforces
  reserved names — only the per-CR **claim/adoption** model bounds the
  credential's blast radius, the way ADR-19's claim model bounds
  `FEATURE_SUPERUSERS_FULL_ACCESS`; reserved-name / disjointness enforcement, if
  desired, is now downstream admission-control work — see *Transparent contract,
  migration, and admission-control policy (Rev 7)*.)*
- **Email-based auto-link is only as safe as the upstream IdP.** `Trust Email` +
  first-broker-login auto-link bypasses Keycloak's own email verification, so the
  pre-provision-by-email flow is safe **only** when the federated IdP verifies email
  ownership. This is an intrinsic, documented trust assumption the realm config and
  runbook must state, not a controller bug to fix.
- **The auto-link prerequisite is now modeled end-to-end for local dev (Rev 5).**
  The `esso` realm + `holos` OIDC broker (alias `esso`) gives the
  first-broker-login auto-link flow an actual identity provider to arrive
  through, so the whole pre-provision-by-email → federated-login → auto-link path
  is exercisable on a fresh local cluster with no external IdP. Because the
  realm/IdP topology is provisioned by config-cli/bootstrap Jobs only — never the
  controller — the realm the controller authenticates against exists **before**
  any controller reconcile, so there is no fresh-cluster provisioning race. The
  cost is the ownership shift of the `holos` realm's `identityProviders[]` from
  the `KeycloakRealmImport` CR to the holos realm-config Job (the
  *Keycloak Configuration as Code* guard rail in AGENTS.md and
  [keycloak-clients.md](../../holos/docs/keycloak-clients.md) are updated to match
  in phases 3/5).
- **The ownership boundary [ADR-18](ADR-18.md) deferred.** *(Revision 7 update:
  this was originally answered with **reserved platform names plus a per-CR claim
  model**. HOL-1421 **removed the reserved-name half from the controller** — the
  retained per-CR claim/adoption model keeps the controller from seizing an
  unadopted foreign object, but **reserved names / project-prefix / tenant↔platform
  disjointness are no longer enforced by the controller**; that enforcement, if a
  cluster wants it, is now downstream **admission-control** work — see *Transparent
  contract, migration, and admission-control policy (Rev 7)*. The original text
  follows as historical.)* Reserved platform names (keyed on the real realm
  identifiers, kept in sync with the realm config) plus a per-CR claim model make
  disjoint ownership safe despite the global-realm / namespaced-CRD tension —
  config-cli's no-delete posture alone would not. Keeping the reserved set in sync
  is itself an implementation guard rail.
- **Foundation for the Project/Application components ([ADR-21](archive/ADR-21.md)).** These
  Keycloak CRs are the identity resources a project's rendered manifests would emit
  alongside the Quay [ADR-19](ADR-19.md) resources; ADR-21 generalizes the
  `my-project` scaffold to emit both halves per project. Advancing this ADR past
  `Proposed` is the CRD-implementation issue
  ([HOL-1344](https://linear.app/holos-run/issue/HOL-1344)), which fixes the
  field-level API the YAML here only illustrates.
