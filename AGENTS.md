# holos-paas

The Holos PaaS: a Kubernetes-native platform delivering a minimum viable
Heroku experience — push a tagged image, get a deploy — managed entirely
through the Kubernetes API and rendered with the
[Holos](https://holos.run/) rendered-manifests pattern.

## Repository layout

The authoritative layout is defined in
[ADR-12 — Repository Layout for Multiple Go Services](docs/adr/ADR-12.md):
a single-module Go monorepo with one multi-service binary (`cmd/holos-paas`,
one subcommand per service), kubebuilder multi-group API conventions
(`api/<group>/<version>`), all implementation under `internal/`, and the
Holos CUE deployment configuration and policy under `holos/`. Read ADR-12
before adding a service, an API group, or moving directories. The evidence
behind the layout is in
[Research: Repository Layouts for Multiple Go Services](docs/research/go-multi-service-repo-layout.md).

## Documentation index

- [docs/adr/](docs/adr/README.md) — Architecture Decision Records: the
  binding design decisions. Start with the index; follow
  [writing-adrs.md](docs/adr/writing-adrs.md) before adding or revising one.
- [docs/planning/holos-paas-mvp-milestones.md](docs/planning/holos-paas-mvp-milestones.md)
  — the MVP plan; mirrors the Linear *Holos PaaS* project milestones.
- [docs/research/](docs/research/) — research reports informing decisions.
- [docs/demo/](docs/demo/README.md) — demo walkthroughs.
- [docs/local-cluster.md](docs/local-cluster.md) — the quick-start guide:
  create the local k3d cluster with DNS and trusted TLS, then apply the
  platform — the Layer 0 foundation and the Layer 1 services (Postgres,
  Keycloak, Quay, Argo CD) — with `scripts/apply`.
- [holos/README.md](holos/README.md) — orientation to the Holos CUE
  directory: layout, clusters, how rendered manifests are applied (the
  apply-order rationale), and the Keycloak, Postgres, Quay, and NATS
  JetStream verification steps and service contracts.
- [holos/docs/component-guidelines.md](holos/docs/component-guidelines.md)
  — how to add a Holos component: anatomy, guardrails, and the
  render-then-commit workflow.
- [holos/docs/mesh-enrollment.md](holos/docs/mesh-enrollment.md) — the
  ambient mesh enrollment convention for platform namespaces, how to verify
  it, and the exceptions.
- [holos/docs/argocd-application-source.md](holos/docs/argocd-application-source.md)
  — the MVP Argo CD `Application` source pattern: OCI rendered-manifests
  artifacts in the in-cluster Quay registry, the repository credential
  Secret shape, and how the repo-server reaches Quay.
- [holos/docs/placeholders.md](holos/docs/placeholders.md) — stubs for
  out-of-MVP-scope concerns: ArgoCD gitops delivery (the `argoAppDisabled`
  flip), observability dashboards, the Gateway route-attachment policy,
  Keycloak realm reconciliation, Quay OIDC login, node-level registry
  trust for in-cluster pulls, NATS in-cluster authentication, production
  deployment area.

## Conventions

- Decisions live in ADRs; revise the existing ADR (and its revision table)
  rather than writing a new one for a refinement.
- Every platform capability is modeled as Kubernetes resources
  ([ADR-2](docs/adr/ADR-2.md)); integrations like Keycloak group membership
  and Quay self-service are CRDs with reconcilers, not imperative tools.
- Deployment configuration and policy are CUE rendered with
  `holos render platform`; `scripts/render` renders and verifies the
  committed `holos/deploy/` tree is diff-clean.
- Label and annotation keys owned by the platform configuration layer —
  aspects of the holos configuration itself, independent of site-specific
  configuration — default to the `holos.run` domain (e.g.
  `app.holos.run/component.name`). `materia.ai` keys must never appear in
  the holos configuration or Go code; the `Guardrails` job in
  [.github/workflows/ci.yaml](.github/workflows/ci.yaml) enforces this.
- Merge pull requests with a **squash merge** (`gh pr merge --squash`) —
  never a merge commit or a rebase merge — so code-review fix commits
  (e.g. `fix: address code review round 1 findings`) are squashed away.
  Clean up the squash commit message before merging: one
  conventional-commit subject and body describing the final change, with
  the review-round noise removed.
