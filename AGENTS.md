# holos-paas

The Holos PaaS: a Kubernetes-native platform delivering a minimum viable
Heroku experience — push a tagged image, get a deploy — managed entirely
through the Kubernetes API and rendered with the
[Holos](https://holos.run/) rendered-manifests pattern.

## Repository layout

The authoritative layout is defined in
[ADR-12 — Repository Layout for Multiple Go Services](docs/adr/ADR-12.md):
a single-module Go monorepo with one multi-service binary (`cmd/holos-paas`,
one subcommand per service), kubebuilder multi-group API conventions
(`api/<group>/<version>`), all implementation under `internal/`, and the
Holos CUE deployment configuration and policy under `holos/`. Read ADR-12
before adding a service, an API group, or moving directories. The evidence
behind the layout is in
[Research: Repository Layouts for Multiple Go Services](docs/research/go-multi-service-repo-layout.md).

Deployment is owned by **Kargo plus the client-side build-and-publish
workflow** ([ADR-16](docs/adr/ADR-16.md)): `scripts/publish` (`make publish`)
renders the platform with an injected app image digest, packages the rendered
manifests with Kustomize, and `oras push`es the OCI artifact to the in-cluster
Quay registry; a Kargo `Warehouse` watches that repository, creates `Freight`,
and a `Stage` promotion runs `argocd-update` to point the Argo CD `Application`
at the new digest. See
[holos/docs/oci-publish-workflow.md](holos/docs/oci-publish-workflow.md) and
[holos/docs/argocd-application-source.md](holos/docs/argocd-application-source.md).

The **platform itself** (as distinct from per-app delivery above) is reconciled
by Argo CD from an **App-of-Apps over an OCI config bundle** ([ADR-16](docs/adr/ADR-16.md)
Rev 3–4, HOL-1373/HOL-1378/HOL-1379): `scripts/publish-config` (`make config-build`/`config-push`)
tars the committed `holos/deploy/` tree as-is under the mutable
`holos-paas-config:dev` tag, and the **platform** root Argo CD `Application`
(`platform-bootstrap`, under the **`platform`** AppProject) reconciles the system
components from it. `scripts/apply` brings Argo CD up imperatively (the bootstrap
floor) and **stops there**, with Quay and Keycloak ready for manual setup; the
chicken-and-egg handoff (Argo CD must exist before it self-manages) is a
**separate, idempotent script — `scripts/apply-platform-app-of-apps`** — that
publishes the bundle and applies the platform root (the "clean cut line": the
platform is fully bootstrapped there, HOL-1382). The split (HOL-1379) breaks a
rebuild-time race: publishing needs the holos Quay **organization** (the public
`holos-paas-config` repository and a push-capable Quay robot credential) configured
first, which does not exist on a freshly rebuilt cluster, so `scripts/apply` would
race the manual Quay setup and fail. `scripts/apply` prints the manual-setup
guidance, and `scripts/apply-platform-app-of-apps` explicitly depends on that Quay
org being configured. The `holos-paas-config` repository is **public** (HOL-1381,
[ADR-16](docs/adr/ADR-16.md) Rev 5), so Argo CD pulls the bundle **anonymously** —
there is no `holos-paas-config-robot` pull credential or repository-credential
bootstrap Job; the `argocd-projects` component instead commits a credential-less
repository registration Secret (only `url`/`type`/`insecure`, no secret material).

**Tenant projects bootstrap separately and independently** (HOL-1382): there is no
longer one global `projects-bootstrap` root. `scripts/apply-projects-app-of-apps`
enumerates the registered projects (`holos cue export ./holos/projects | jq`) and,
for **each** project, calls `scripts/apply-project-app-of-apps <project>` — which
builds+pushes that project's **own** public OCI config bundle
(`holos/<project>-config:dev`) and applies its **`<project>-control-plane`** root
(the platform-managed control plane: AppProject, Applications, Kargo/Quay/Keycloak
CRs, RBAC — `directory.exclude: **/workload/**`). The project's **service owner**
then applies the **`<project>-workload`** root (`directory.include: **/workload/**`,
the app `Deployment`/`Service`/`HTTPRoute`/…) with
`scripts/apply-project-workload-app-of-apps <project>`, **after** the control
plane. The two top-level scripts (`apply-platform-app-of-apps`,
`apply-projects-app-of-apps`) are **completely independent and never call each
other**. The collection-driven `project-app-of-apps` component emits the per-project
roots; the `project` component now renders its (all control-plane) resources into a
`control-plane/` subtree, mirroring the `application` component's
control-plane/workload split.

The per-app Kargo delivery is unchanged and
complementary (it still owns each app's `Application.spec.source.targetRevision`).
This supersedes the deferred per-component `argoAppDisabled` git-source projection
**for the platform** (which stays dormant). See ADR-16 Rev 3–5
(*Bootstrap delivery — the App-of-Apps OCI config bundle*),
[holos/docs/oci-publish-workflow.md](holos/docs/oci-publish-workflow.md)
(*Platform config bundle*), and
[holos/docs/placeholders.md](holos/docs/placeholders.md) (*ArgoCD gitops delivery*).

All three service images (`holos-paas`, `holos-controller`,
`holos-authenticator` — the last [ADR-23](docs/adr/ADR-23.md), HOL-1385) have
multi-arch `make` targets — `make docker-buildx` / `make controller-docker-buildx`
(HOL-1333) / `make authenticator-docker-buildx` — that build and push a single
OCI image index spanning `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` via a shared
`docker-container` buildx builder (`make docker-buildx-builder` bootstraps it; no
QEMU, the Go toolchain cross-compiles from `$BUILDPLATFORM`). The
single-`PLATFORM` `docker-build`/`docker-push` targets remain for local-cluster
use. The manual
[`.github/workflows/images.yaml`](.github/workflows/images.yaml) **Images**
workflow (HOL-1334) publishes the multi-arch images from CI — `workflow_dispatch`
only (never on push/PR/tag), with each image a **discrete job** (an `image`
input selects `both`/`holos-paas`/`holos-controller`/`holos-authenticator`, where
`both` builds all three and any single value builds only that one) sharing the
reusable
[`build-image.yaml`](.github/workflows/build-image.yaml) workflow, gated behind a
`publish-images` GitHub Environment, taking `ref`/`tag` inputs and pushing to
`ghcr.io/<owner>/holos-{paas,controller,authenticator}`. It drives the same
buildx make targets, so the build logic is single-sourced.
See [README.md](README.md) (*Container image* → *Multi-arch images* /
*Publishing images from CI*).

The earlier NATS event-driven deployment pipeline — the **webhook receiver**
([ADR-9](docs/adr/ADR-9.md)), the **webhook subscriber**
([ADR-10](docs/adr/ADR-10.md)), and the deployer/render-task path
([ADR-11](docs/adr/ADR-11.md), [ADR-14](docs/adr/ADR-14.md)) — was retired in
HOL-1241. Those ADRs are now `Deprecated` and superseded by ADR-16; the
receiver/subscriber subcommands, their `internal/` packages, the NATS pipeline
protobuf schemas, and the `nats`/`webhook-receiver`/`webhook-subscriber` Holos
components have been removed. Git history preserves them.

## Guard Rails

### CUE Component Rendering
- **Rule:** All changes to files under `holos/components/` MUST be followed by running `scripts/render` to regenerate the corresponding manifests under `holos/deploy/`.
- **Why:** The render script enforces that the committed deploy tree matches the CUE source exactly. Drift between source and deployed manifests can mask outdated or broken configurations.
- **How to apply:** After editing any `.cue` file:
  1. Commit the CUE changes
  2. Run `scripts/render` (it will fail if holos/ has uncommitted changes)
  3. Commit the regenerated YAML in `holos/deploy/` together with the source changes
  - See `holos/docs/component-guidelines.md` for full workflow details.

### No raw inline YAML/JSON in CUE — marshal it
- **Rule:** Embedded YAML or JSON config documents in a `.cue` file MUST be authored as a CUE struct and serialized with `encoding/yaml.Marshal()` or `encoding/json.Marshal()`. Never hand-write the config as a triple-quoted string with `\(...)` interpolation — indentation and types must be correct by construction, not by hand. The only sanctioned exception is shell/script heredocs (which are not YAML/JSON documents).
- **Why:** A marshalled CUE struct is type-checked, correctly indented, and free of interpolation-injection and whitespace bugs; a triple-quoted blob is none of those and silently drifts. The platform already standardizes on this: argocd's `OIDC_CONFIG` (the argocd-cm `oidc.config` block) uses `yaml.Marshal`, keycloak's `REALM_CONFIG` (the keycloak-config-cli import document) uses `json.Marshal`, and the refactored quay `CONFIG` (the `config.yaml` ConfigMap) uses `yaml.Marshal`.
- **How to apply:** Author the config as a CUE struct (a `let` binding or field), then set the consuming field to `yaml.Marshal(THAT_STRUCT)` (for a `.yaml`/`.yml` document) or `json.Marshal(THAT_STRUCT)` (for a `.json` document). Import `"encoding/yaml"` / `"encoding/json"` as needed. After editing, run `scripts/render` per the *CUE Component Rendering* guardrail.
- **Reference:** `holos/components/argocd/controller/buildplan.cue` (`OIDC_CONFIG` → `yaml.Marshal`), `holos/components/keycloak/realm-config/buildplan.cue` (`REALM_CONFIG` → `json.Marshal`), `holos/components/quay/buildplan.cue` (`CONFIG` → `yaml.Marshal`).

### Cross-namespace references between holos.run CRs need a ReferenceGrant (ADR-22)
- **Rule:** Every cross-namespace reference between `holos.run` custom resources MUST be authorized by a `security.holos.run` `ReferenceGrant` placed in the **referent (target) namespace** — the namespace holding the object being referenced. The grant declares `spec.from[]` (group/kind/namespace of the authorized referrers) and `spec.to[]` (group/kind, optionally `name`, of the local objects that may be referenced), mirroring Gateway API's `ReferenceGrant` From/To shape. A cross-namespace reference with **no matching grant is rejected** by the referrer's reconciler (a `Ready=False` status condition) — never silently honored.
- **Why:** Without an explicit grant, any namespace could reference any object in any other namespace — the confused-deputy / silent-cross-tenant-access hazard Gateway API's `ReferenceGrant` exists to prevent. The trust model is asymmetric and default-deny: the **platform owner** of the referent namespace grants access by creating the `ReferenceGrant` there; **platform users** then reference the granted object from CRs in their own (project) namespaces, and cannot widen their own access. A holos-owned grant (not Gateway API's `gateway.networking.k8s.io` `ReferenceGrant`, which governs only a fixed set of Gateway/Route kinds) generalizes the pattern to arbitrary `holos.run` CR-to-CR references (e.g. a `keycloak.holos.run` `User`/`Group`/`Client` referencing a `KeycloakInstance` in another namespace); the two grants coexist. `ReferenceGrant` itself takes **no** dependency on any external system — it is pure Kubernetes-native policy the referrers' reconcilers consult.
- **How to apply:** When a `holos.run` CR must reference another `holos.run` CR in a different namespace, do **not** reference it directly and hope the controller's credential resolves it. Have the referent namespace's owner create a `security.holos.run` `ReferenceGrant` in that namespace authorizing the referrer's group/kind/namespace (`from`) to reference the local object (`to`). The referrer's reconciler checks for the grant and sets `Ready=False` naming the missing grant if absent. (The `security.holos.run` `ReferenceGrant` CRD and the `internal/referencegrant` authorization helper shipped in HOL-1343 per ADR-22; the `keycloak.holos.run` reconcilers enforce it for cross-namespace `instanceRef`s, and the `keycloak-instance` component emits the grant authorizing `my-project` to reference the central `KeycloakInstance`.)
- **Reference:** [ADR-22](docs/adr/ADR-22.md) (the `security.holos.run` API group and the `ReferenceGrant` cross-namespace reference convention), [ADR-21](docs/adr/ADR-21.md) (the authoritative Gateway-API `ReferenceGrant` semantics — referent-namespace placement, object references vs. route attachment).

### Rich Gateway-API status reporting on all holos.run CRs (ADR-22, ADR-19, ADR-18)
- **Rule:** Every `holos.run` custom resource MUST report rich status following the Quay/Gateway-API model: a `status.conditions[]` slice of standard `metav1.Condition` (`+listType=map`, `+listMapKey=type`, merge-patch on `type`) with the standard `Accepted`/`Programmed`/`Ready` condition types, plus a `status.observedGeneration` recording the last `spec` generation reconciled, plus at least one `+kubebuilder:printcolumn` surfacing `Ready` (a column whose JSONPath selects `status.conditions[?(@.type=="Ready")].status` — see the `quay.holos.run` types for the exact marker). Define the condition types and reasons once (shared constants) rather than re-deriving per reconciler.
- **Why:** Consistent, legible status is how an operator (and Argo CD's health assessment) tells a provisioned, usable resource from a stuck or rejected one — and it is how a rejected cross-namespace reference (the `ReferenceGrant` guard rail above) becomes observable (`Ready=False` naming the missing grant). `Accepted` (the spec was understood and claimed), `Programmed` (the desired state was written to the backend), and `Ready` (fully provisioned and usable) give a uniform, Gateway-API-aligned vocabulary across every group; `observedGeneration` distinguishes a reconciled spec from a freshly-edited one. The `quay.holos.run` Organization/Repository CRDs already ship exactly this shape (ADR-19), and it generalizes the established controller status approach (ADR-18) to **all** CRs.
- **How to apply:** On each CR's `status`, add `Conditions []metav1.Condition` with the `+listType=map` / `+listMapKey=type` markers and `patchStrategy:"merge" patchMergeKey:"type"`, an `ObservedGeneration int64`, and a `+kubebuilder:printcolumn` surfacing `Ready` (and any Kind-specific columns). Use `Accepted`/`Programmed`/`Ready` as the standard types (adding Kind-specific types like the Repository's `WebhookConfigured` only when they add legibility), with named reasons defined once in a shared `conditions.go`. The reconciler sets `observedGeneration` and merges conditions on every reconcile.
- **Reference:** [ADR-22](docs/adr/ADR-22.md) (mandates this for all CRs), [ADR-19](docs/adr/ADR-19.md) (the as-built precedent — *Status conditions (Gateway-API model)*, `api/quay/v1alpha1/organization_types.go` / `repository_types.go`, `internal/controller/quay/conditions.go`), [ADR-18](docs/adr/ADR-18.md) (the controller status model).

### Known Issues & Workarounds

#### Quay auth: OIDC sole identity store, Keycloak SSO, no PKCE + team syncing on (HOL-1293/HOL-1317, ADR-15 Revision 4)
- **Model (HOL-1293, ADR-15 Revision 4):** Quay runs `AUTHENTICATION_TYPE: OIDC` — the Keycloak `holos` realm is the **sole identity store**. There is **no** local `admin` user, and the `/api/v1/user/initialize` + `/api/v1/superuser/*` headless-bootstrap APIs are unavailable under OIDC by design. Users sign in with the **Holos SSO** button (Authorization Code flow) via the realm's confidential `quay` client. Revision 4 reverses Revision 3's brief Database-backend + federated-login model — **never** reintroduce `AUTHENTICATION_TYPE: Database`, `FEATURE_USER_INITIALIZE`, or a `quay-initial-admin`/`quay-admin-bootstrap` headless token.
- **`FEATURE_TEAM_SYNCING: true`:** team syncing is **enabled** (`FEATURE_TEAM_SYNCING: true` with `TEAM_RESYNC_STALE_TIME: 30m`). Under the OIDC backend the active user handler syncs the `groups` claim into Quay teams, so a synced team's **membership** tracks the claim automatically. (The Revision 3 `FEATURE_TEAM_SYNCING: false` workaround existed only because the Database user handler had no `sync_user_groups`; that constraint is gone with the OIDC backend.) **Which** teams exist, their **org role** (`admin`/`creator`/`member`), and their optional **org default repository permission** (`read`/`write`/`admin`) are declared **on the Organization CR** (`spec.syncedTeams[]`, HOL-1325, ADR-19 Revision 6) and reconciled by the shipped Holos Controller — Quay's `FEATURE_TEAM_SYNCING` keeps each team's membership in sync, the controller owns the team set/roles/default permissions. OIDC groups are referenced **by name** (the `oidcGroup` string); the `quay.holos.run` API group imports no Keycloak type.
- **PKCE disabled (HOL-1317):** the `quay` client uses **no** PKCE on either end — the Keycloak `quay` client sets `pkce.code.challenge.method` to the empty/"none" method (set explicitly, not omitted, so keycloak-config-cli's attribute merge overwrites any prior `S256` rather than leaving it to linger) and Quay's `KEYCLOAK_LOGIN_CONFIG` sets `USE_PKCE: false` (no `PKCE_METHOD`). Quay 3.17.3 mishandles PKCE state: it stores the `code_challenge`/verifier in the `_csrf_token` cookie and never clears it on logout, so a stale verifier is replayed on the next login and Keycloak rejects the exchange with `Got non-2XX response for code exchange: 400` (login-after-logout fails). HOL-1317 makes `quay` a deliberate PKCE exception again — the public `argocd`/`kargo` clients keep `S256`; only `quay` drops it. Do **not** reintroduce `pkce.code.challenge.method` on the Keycloak `quay` client or set `USE_PKCE: true` on the Quay side without first confirming the Quay logout-state bug is fixed (this reverses the brief HOL-1293/HOL-1294 PKCE re-enablement). The Keycloak `quay` client's `redirectUris` are the three explicit `/oauth2/keycloak/callback{,/attach,/cli}` paths from HOL-1317 (not a `/*` wildcard) with an empty `webOrigins`.
- **Superusers:** `SUPER_USERS` lists two Keycloak realm users by `preferred_username` — the service account **`svc-quay-resource-controller`** and the human **`quay-admin`** (both seeded by the keycloak phase, HOL-1294, with passwords generated once at runtime into Secrets of the same name in the `keycloak` namespace, key `password`). There is no local-`admin` break-glass account.
- **Data plane: org/repo/webhook/synced-teams now reconciled by the shipped controller; robots/pull-Secrets still manual:** the **Holos Controller** ([ADR-18](docs/adr/ADR-18.md)) has **shipped** (HOL-1309..HOL-1313, namespace `holos-controller`) with the `quay.holos.run/v1alpha1` Organization and Repository CRDs ([ADR-19](docs/adr/ADR-19.md), `Status: Implemented`, `Updates: ADR-15`), so in-cluster Quay **org/repo creation, the repo's `repo_push` webhook, and the org's OIDC-synced teams** (the Organization's `spec.syncedTeams[]` — team org role plus optional org default repository permission, HOL-1325, ADR-19 Revision 6) are reconciled declaratively. The robots and the Argo CD / Kargo pull-credential Secrets are **not** yet modeled by the `v1alpha1` CRDs (ADR-19 *Out of scope*) and stay manual for now. An operator still mints the controller's superuser OAuth-Application credential by hand (the credentials runbook below) into `holos-controller-quay-creds` (`holos-controller` namespace); the controller reads it via `credentialsSecretRef`. The removed `scripts/quay-init`/`scripts/quay-reset` helpers and the `my-project-quay-bootstrap` Job no longer exist.
- **`FEATURE_SUPERUSERS_FULL_ACCESS: true` (HOL-1299):** the `SUPER_USERS` reach is extended to orgs they neither own nor are members of, so the Holos Controller ([ADR-18](docs/adr/ADR-18.md)/[ADR-19](docs/adr/ADR-19.md)) can **adopt** and reconcile orgs created by other identities (its Organization claim model gates adoption on `spec.adopt`) — without it, `super:user` reaches only the `/api/v1/superuser/*` panel endpoints and a write inside a non-owned org `403`s. It applies to `SUPER_USERS` members only, but to **all** of their superuser sessions: both an OAuth token carrying the `super:user` scope (the controller) **and** an authenticated web/UI session (Quay grants superuser permission for `super:user` **or** the internal `direct_user_login` scope), so the human `quay-admin` signed in via "Holos SSO" also gains instance-wide read/write/delete across every org. This is not configurable per-user; it does not widen access for non-superusers. **Disambiguation (HOL-1299):** a Quay OAuth Application (and its token) can only be created inside an **organization**, never directly "for" a user; the token acts as the **user who generated it**, bounded by that user's rights and the token's scopes — the host org (the manually-created **`platform-automation`** org owned by `svc-quay-resource-controller`) is **not** a permission boundary, just where the credential record lives.
- **Related:** `holos/components/keycloak/realm-config/buildplan.cue` (the `quay` client — `pkce.code.challenge.method: ""` empty/"none" method (HOL-1317); the `svc-quay-resource-controller`/`quay-admin` realm users), `holos/components/quay/buildplan.cue` (`AUTHENTICATION_TYPE: OIDC`, `FEATURE_TEAM_SYNCING: true`, `FEATURE_SUPERUSERS_FULL_ACCESS: true`, `USE_PKCE: false` (HOL-1317), the `SUPER_USERS` list, the `KEYCLOAK_LOGIN_CONFIG` block), `docs/adr/ADR-15.md` (Revision 7), `docs/adr/ADR-18.md` (the shipped Holos Controller — the Quay Resource Controller, `Partially Implemented`), `docs/adr/ADR-19.md` (the `quay.holos.run` Organization/Repository CRDs, `Implemented`), `holos/docs/keycloak-clients.md` (the PKCE guardrail checklist), `docs/runbooks/quay-keycloak-oidc.md` (the operational runbook), `docs/runbooks/quay-resource-controller-credentials.md` (the manual superuser OAuth-Application credential procedure, including the `platform-automation` org bootstrap and the full-access semantics), and `docs/runbooks/holos-controller.md` (wiring the controller to that credential, AC #3).

### Keycloak Configuration as Code
- **Pattern:** The holos realm (users, groups, clients, roles, protocol mappers) is fully declarative, reconciled on every `scripts/apply` via a keycloak-config-cli Job.
- **Scope:** The Job imports only `realm: "holos"` — it does NOT manage the realm's `enabled` field, which is owned by the `KeycloakRealmImport` CR in the instance component. As of HOL-1369 the holos realm's `identityProviders[]` (the `esso` OIDC broker) IS owned by this realm-config Job, so the IdP's confidential `clientSecret` can be injected at runtime via `$(env:ESSO_IDP_CLIENT_SECRET)` (read from the shared `esso-idp-oidc` Secret the `realm-esso-config` component generates). There is no contention: the `KeycloakRealmImport` declares NO `identityProviders`, so the two reconciliation paths own disjoint fields (`enabled` → import CR; `identityProviders[]` and everything else under `realm: "holos"` → this Job). The `esso` IdP also owns the realm's first-broker-login auto-link flow: it is declared as a CUSTOM (`builtIn: false`) `authenticationFlows[]` pair with unique aliases and pointed at via `firstBrokerLoginFlowAlias` — NOT a redefinition of Keycloak's built-in "first broker login", which keycloak-config-cli refuses to add executions to (the `idp-auto-link` "Cannot find stored execution" failure HOL-1369 fixed).
- **Generate-once guarantee:** Secrets generated at runtime (e.g., Quay OIDC client secret) are created once and never rotated, so they remain stable across reconciles. Bootstrap Jobs idempotently check for existing secrets before creating.

### Runtime Secret Handling (binding guardrail)
- **Rule:** A Secret's *material* is created at runtime — via an `ExternalSecret` or a create-if-absent bootstrap `Job` — and never committed to the repo. The deploy tree under `holos/deploy/` never holds a Secret's material. (Chart-owned empty Secrets a controller populates in place — e.g. `kargo-api`, `argocd-secret` — are fine; what's forbidden is committing the value, or an empty-data placeholder for a bootstrap-Job-managed Secret, which would defeat the Job.)
- **Resolving ambiguous AC:** When an acceptance criterion asks a `Secret` to "render"/"be committed"/appear under `holos/deploy/`, **resolve it directly by handling the Secret at runtime** — do NOT mark the issue `needs-human-review` or leave it open for a human to confirm. The tradeoff is already decided by this guardrail.
- **Key naming:** Write only the key(s) the consumer actually reads (verified against its contract, e.g. the vendored CRD). Never carry an extra unread key "for AC compliance" — it is dead code. If an AC names a wrong key, use the correct one and drop the named one.
- **Reference:** `holos/docs/secret-handling.md` (the full guardrail, indexed below).

### OIDC Client Secrets
- **Rule:** OIDC client secrets are generated at runtime, never committed. (A specific case of *Runtime Secret Handling* above.)
- **Pattern:** A bootstrap Job generates the secret once and writes it to both the owning component's namespace and any consuming namespace (e.g., keycloak and quay for the Quay OIDC secret).
- **Reference:** `holos/components/keycloak/realm-config/buildplan.cue`, QUAY_OIDC_BOOTSTRAP section

### Project Delivery Scaffold (collection-driven Project + Application templates)
- **Pattern (ADR-21, `Implemented`):** A project that receives Kargo-driven OCI delivery is no longer a bespoke per-instance component. As of HOL-1357 the hand-authored `holos/components/my-project/` component is **deleted**; standing up a project (or an app within one) is a **one-line registration** rendered by two collection-driven components — the **Project component** (`holos/components/project/buildplan.cue`) and the **Application component** (`holos/components/application/buildplan.cue`). A product engineer adds `projects: "<name>": owners: "<email>": _` to `holos/projects/<name>.cue` and `apps: "<app>": {project: "<name>", image: …, port: …}` to `holos/apps/<app>.cue`; the renderer composes and validates the full resource set, failing at **render time** on a malformed name, a missing required app field, or an app naming a non-existent project (`holos/collections.cue` `#CollectionsValidated`, `holos/namespaces.cue` `#RegisteredNamespace`/`#ReservedNamespaceNames`/`#ProjectNameNoEnvPrefix`). The detailed authoring guide is [holos/docs/project-and-application-templates.md](holos/docs/project-and-application-templates.md); read it (and [ADR-21](docs/adr/ADR-21.md)) before adding or changing a project/app. `my-project` (`holos/projects/my-project.cue` + `holos/apps/my-app.cue`) is the reference instance and the template for a future self-service `ProjectRequest`.
- **Env-prefixed namespace topology + the bare-`<name>` control namespace:** Each `projects.<name>` entry derives **one Namespace per environment** — `ci-<name>`, `qa-<name>`, `prod-<name>` — plus the **bare `<name>` control namespace**, all from `holos/namespaces.cue` (the `#Environments` / `#ProjectNamespace` comprehension), each carrying `_ambient: true`, the `kargo.akuity.io/project: "true"` adoption label, and the `kargo.akuity.io/keep-namespace: "true"` annotation. The `namespaces` component renders the actual `Namespace` manifests; the Project/Application components only **reference** the derived names (the no-inline-`Namespace` guardrail). The project-scoped control-plane CRs (the Quay `Organization`, the `keycloak.holos.run` groups/user/client, the adopted cluster-scoped Kargo `Project` namespace) land in the **bare `<name>`** namespace — **a deliberate as-built deviation from ADR-21 Revision 3's `prod-<name>` pick**, forced by the controller's `validateDirectClientRole` guard (HOL-1350) which requires a role group's CR namespace to equal the bare project name for the direct-`clientId` Quay-client role grant; bare `<name>` is also what the deleted bespoke component used. `#ProjectControlEnvironment` (`"prod"`) is still defined and the `prod-<name>` env namespace still carries the per-app validation annotation, but the CRs use bare `<name>`. ADR-21 Revision 4 ratifies this. The `ci-/qa-/prod-<name>` namespaces are scaffolded; only the bare-`<name>` delivery path is wired (ADR-21 "scaffold envs, wire one delivery path").
- **What the Project component emits per `projects.<name>`:** the Argo CD `AppProject` + project-level `Application` (in `argocd`, OCI source, `targetRevision` omitted and the `kargo.akuity.io/authorized-stage` annotation present so Kargo is authorized to own that field), the Kargo `Project`/`ProjectConfig`/`Warehouse`/`Stage` + the receiver-token bootstrap `Job` (shared by every app in the project), the owner `RoleBinding`, the `quay.holos.run` **Organization** (`spec.syncedTeams[]` — the GCP-style `<name>-owner`→`role: admin`, `<name>-editor`→`role: creator`+`repositoryPermission: write`, `<name>-viewer`→`role: member`+`repositoryPermission: read` example) with a gated `spec.caBundle`, and the project's **`keycloak.holos.run` CRs**: the nested role/custodian `KeycloakGroup`s (`projects/<name>/{roles,custodians}/{owner,editor,viewer}`), the owner `KeycloakUser` (e.g. `bob@example.com`), and the project `KeycloakClient` (`https://<name>.holos.internal`). The shipped Holos Controller ([ADR-18](docs/adr/ADR-18.md)/[ADR-19](docs/adr/ADR-19.md)/[ADR-20](docs/adr/ADR-20.md)) reconciles the Quay Organization (creating the org + OIDC-synced teams) and the Keycloak CRs (into the `holos` realm). The Keycloak CRs reference the central `KeycloakInstance` (the separate `keycloak-instance` component) cross-namespace, authorized by a `security.holos.run` `ReferenceGrant` the instance namespace's owner creates (not rendered by the component).
- **What the Application component emits per `apps.<name>`:** a **workload** bundle (Argo CD syncs it from the published `<app>-config` OCI artifact) — `Deployment`, `Service`, `HTTPRoute` (to the shared Gateway at `host`, default `<app>.holos.internal`), `ConfigMap`, `ServiceAccount`, a view `RoleBinding` — and a **control-plane** bundle (operator-applied) — the app `KeycloakClient`, the Quay `Repository` (within the project's Organization, gated `caBundle`), the Kargo `Warehouse`/`Stage`, and the app's Argo CD `Application` (in `argocd`, named `<project>-<app>`, destination the project namespace). The shared Kargo control plane is the **Project** component's, not re-emitted per app. The app Quay `Repository`'s `repo_push` webhook **registration** is omitted in the current phase (the Warehouse polls as the fallback) until the Kargo receiver URL is published into a referenceable Secret; the push robot and the Argo CD/Kargo pull-credential Secrets stay manual (ADR-19 *Out of scope*).
- **Role → Quay-client + role → app-client binding (HOL-1350, ADR-20 Rev 4):** each project role `KeycloakGroup` confers its primitive role on **three** clients via `clientRoles[]`: (1) the **platform Quay client** (`https://quay.holos.internal`) named directly by `clientId`, conferring `<name>-<role>` — the existing `quay-client-roles` mapper emits it into the `groups` claim and the Organization's `spec.syncedTeams[].oidcGroup` membership populates; (2) the **project's own client** (`clientRef`), conferring `<name>-<role>`; and (3) **each app's client** (`clientRef`), conferring the **bare** primitive role (`owner`/`editor`/`viewer`) the Application component defines on that app client, so project-role membership maps onto matching app roles. The direct-`clientId` Quay path is tightly guarded (`validateDirectClientRole`): the target must be the Quay client (an allowlist — not `realm-management`/`argocd`/`kargo`), the path must be a `projects/<project>/roles/<leaf>` role group whose **`<project>` equals the CR's namespace** (the project↔namespace ownership boundary), and the role must be **exactly** `<project>-<leaf>`. The reconciler ensures the role and assigns it **without seizing** the client object; the `KeycloakClient` reserved-name guard still forbids a tenant CR from reconfiguring the `quay` client.
- **`caBundle` field convention (ADR-19) + apply step:** both `quay.holos.run` Kinds (Organization, Repository) carry `spec.caBundle` — a PEM/base64 (`[]byte`) bundle of x509 CA certs the controller trusts **in addition to** its system store when reaching the Quay API; empty/omitted uses the pod's system trust store unchanged. The project/app CRs fill it with the per-cluster local-ca PEM, injected at apply time by **`scripts/apply-projects`** (not `scripts/apply`) via the `ca_bundle_pem` CUE tag (the `scripts/publish` `--inject` pattern), so the committed `holos/deploy/` tree carries **no** `caBundle` material. `scripts/apply-projects` reads the local-ca PEM, renders with it injected, and applies each rendered project + app control-plane bundle; it runs **after** `scripts/local-ca`, the manual Quay superuser-credential setup, and the platform foundation (`scripts/apply`). An operator mints the controller's OAuth-Application credential (`docs/runbooks/quay-resource-controller-credentials.md`, consumed per `docs/runbooks/holos-controller.md`) and provisions the still-manual scaffolding by hand; a project's Argo CD Application stays `Unknown`/`Missing` until the first config artifact is published — expected scaffolding.
- **Hand-authored Application vs. the deferred projection:** The sample Applications (`echo`, and `my-project`'s project/app Applications rendered by the templates) are **OCI**-source Applications, distinct from the deferred per-component `argoAppDisabled` **git**-source projection (`holos/docs/placeholders.md` → *ArgoCD gitops delivery*). Do not conflate them.
- **Deferred follow-ups (ADR-21, recorded in placeholders + the guide):** the full `ci → qa → prod` Kargo promotion chain across the env namespaces + blue-green progressive delivery, the external-secrets store/controller prerequisite for app `ExternalSecret`s, and the self-service `ProjectRequest` API remain open. See [holos/docs/placeholders.md](holos/docs/placeholders.md) → *Project/Application templates: deferred follow-ups*.

### Adding a Keycloak OIDC (PKCE) Client
- **Pattern:** The realm's OIDC clients (argocd, quay) are declared in `realm-config/buildplan.cue` and reconciled by the `keycloak-config` keycloak-config-cli Job. The conventional declarative-client pattern — public vs confidential decision, the `S256` attribute, the confidential secret-bootstrap Job, `IMPORT_VARSUBSTITUTION_ENABLED`, the three mappers that feed the shared `groups` claim, the role model, and the render-then-commit workflow — is documented as a guardrail checklist.
- **Before adding another PKCE client:** Read `holos/docs/keycloak-clients.md` and follow its guardrail checklist rather than rediscovering the pattern. Default to requiring PKCE (`pkce.code.challenge.method: "S256"`) for every client; relax it only for a client with a demonstrated implementation gap. The `argocd` and `kargo` clients use `S256`; the confidential `quay` client is the one PKCE exception — HOL-1317 dropped PKCE for it because Quay 3.17.3 replays a stale `code_verifier` after logout and breaks the next login (reversing the brief HOL-1293/HOL-1294 re-enablement). The `quay` client is confidential (authenticated by its client secret) where `argocd`/`kargo` are public. Under the OIDC backend (ADR-15 Revision 4) the Keycloak `holos` realm is Quay's sole identity store, so for `quay` the OIDC client *is* the identity backend, not merely a login overlay.
- **Reference:** `holos/docs/keycloak-clients.md`, `docs/runbooks/quay-keycloak-oidc.md`

### Quay Superuser Credential — manual OAuth-Application token (HOL-1293)
- **Rule:** Quay's REST API takes a **superuser OAuth token**, and under the OIDC backend (ADR-15 Revision 4) there is **no headless** way to mint one — the local `admin` user and the one-shot `/api/v1/user/initialize` endpoint do not exist. The credential is created **by hand**: an operator signs in via "Holos SSO" as the realm superuser `svc-quay-resource-controller` (password from its Secret in the `keycloak` namespace), creates a Quay OAuth Application, and generates a scoped token. **Do not** reintroduce a `quay-initial-admin`/`quay-admin-bootstrap` Job, the `FEATURE_USER_INITIALIZE` endpoint, or any assumption of an automatically-minted token — they were removed (HOL-1293).
- **Why manual:** the OIDC backend makes the Keycloak realm the sole identity store, which is the deliberate trade for declarative identity (no second password store, no break-glass local admin). Quay ships no operator to mint a first superuser token declaratively, so the bootstrap stays a documented manual step. The **Quay Resource Controller** has **shipped** as the **Holos Controller** ([ADR-18](docs/adr/ADR-18.md)) with the `quay.holos.run` CRDs ([ADR-19](docs/adr/ADR-19.md), `Status: Implemented`) and takes over the **org/repo/webhook provisioning** — but it still *consumes* this superuser OAuth-Application token (it authenticates to Quay with the credential the runbook mints), so the manual mint stays operationally true. The token is the controller's external credential, not one of the CRDs it reconciles; the contract is the **`holos-controller-quay-creds` Secret** (keys `url`/`token`/optional `username`) in the **`holos-controller` namespace**, which each resource's `credentialsSecretRef` defaults to. The `apply-svc-quay-resource-controller-creds` helper creates it; `docs/runbooks/holos-controller.md` documents the consumer-side wiring (AC #3).
- **The two superusers:** `SUPER_USERS` lists the Keycloak realm users `svc-quay-resource-controller` (service account — its `svc-` prefix marks it as such) and `quay-admin` (human). Both passwords are generated once at runtime into Secrets of the same name in the `keycloak` namespace (key `password`); retrieve with `kubectl -n keycloak get secret <name> -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 -d`.
- **How to apply:** Follow `docs/runbooks/quay-resource-controller-credentials.md` to create the OAuth Application, choose its scopes (e.g. `super:user`/`org:admin`/`repo:create`), generate the token, and store it (via `scripts/apply-svc-quay-resource-controller-creds`) as the `holos-controller-quay-creds` Secret (keys `url`/`token`/optional `username`) in the `holos-controller` namespace — the credential the shipped controller reads. Store the token as a Secret's *material* per the *Runtime Secret Handling* guardrail — never commit it. See `docs/runbooks/holos-controller.md` for the consumer-side wiring.
- **Reference:** `holos/components/quay/buildplan.cue` (`AUTHENTICATION_TYPE: OIDC`, `SUPER_USERS`, `FEATURE_SUPERUSERS_FULL_ACCESS: true`), `holos/components/keycloak/realm-config/buildplan.cue` (the `svc-quay-resource-controller`/`quay-admin` realm users + password Secrets), `scripts/apply-svc-quay-resource-controller-creds` (creates `holos-controller-quay-creds` in `holos-controller`), `docs/runbooks/quay-resource-controller-credentials.md` (the manual credential procedure, the `platform-automation` org bootstrap, and the full-access semantics), `docs/runbooks/holos-controller.md` (the consumer-side credential wiring + AC #3 superuser-token assumption), `docs/runbooks/quay-keycloak-oidc.md` (the OIDC model and superuser verification), `docs/adr/ADR-15.md` (Revision 7), `docs/adr/ADR-18.md`/`docs/adr/ADR-19.md` (the shipped Holos Controller + Quay CRDs that reconcile the org/repo/webhook provisioning; the controller consumes this superuser token as its external credential).

## Documentation index

- [docs/adr/](docs/adr/README.md) — Architecture Decision Records: the
  binding design decisions. Start with the index; follow
  [writing-adrs.md](docs/adr/writing-adrs.md) before adding or revising one.
  The **Holos Controller** design set lives here: ADR-18 (the controller and
  its GitOps rendered-manifest delivery model, `Partially Implemented`), ADR-19
  (`quay.holos.run` Organization/Repository CRDs, **`Implemented`** as built,
  `Updates: ADR-15`; Revision 6 adds the Organization's `syncedTeams[]` —
  OIDC-synced Quay teams with org role + optional default repository permission,
  the GCP-style owner/editor/viewer primitive-role model), ADR-20 (the Keycloak
  API group CRDs, **`Partially Implemented`** as built in HOL-1344..HOL-1350,
  `Updates: ADR-3`), ADR-21 (the Holos Project/Application components,
  **`Implemented`** as built in HOL-1354..HOL-1358 — Rev 4, `Updates: ADR-1`),
  and ADR-22 (the `security.holos.run` API group
  and its `ReferenceGrant` cross-namespace reference convention, shipped in
  HOL-1343).
  ADR-23 (the **Holos Authenticator** — an Istio gRPC `ext_authz` authorizer
  for OIDC → Kubernetes impersonation, **`Implemented`** as built in
  HOL-1385..HOL-1390 — Rev 3, `Updates: ADR-3`) is a separate service in the
  same monorepo (`cmd/holos-authenticator`, namespace `holos-authenticator`),
  not part of the controller's API groups; it reuses the controller's
  build/release machinery template. Rev 3 (HOL-1392..HOL-1395) adds **KSA /
  static-JWKS backends**: an additive `spec.oidc.jwks` lets a `Backend` validate
  service-account ID tokens **offline** against a static JWKS (no OIDC discovery;
  `iss`/`aud`/`exp` still enforced), fronting a remote cluster's API server 1:1
  by host — per-`kid` key-selection hardening is deferred to HOL-1396.
  The controller (`holos-controller` namespace)
  and its Quay **and Keycloak** API groups have **shipped** (Quay
  HOL-1309..HOL-1313; Keycloak + `security.holos.run` HOL-1343..HOL-1348) —
  formerly the "future Quay Resource Controller". The `keycloak.holos.run` group
  reconciles `KeycloakInstance`/`Group`/`User`/`Client`, and the **collection-driven
  Project + Application components** (ADR-21, the generalization of the deleted
  bespoke `my-project` component) emit each project's and app's CRs from one-line
  `holos/projects/`/`holos/apps/` registrations.

  is the worked example (fixed in HOL-1370 by an additive allow-policy in the

  mappers that feed the shared `groups` claim, the realm/client role model
  (including `platform-owner` into the quay client), the Quay superuser model
  (`SUPER_USERS` = `svc-quay-resource-controller`/`quay-admin`), and the
  guardrail checklist for adding a new PKCE client (`argocd`/`kargo` use `S256`;
  the confidential `quay` client is the lone no-PKCE exception, HOL-1317).

  operational runbook for the Quay↔Keycloak OIDC SSO integration: the
  **OIDC sole-identity-store** model (`AUTHENTICATION_TYPE: OIDC`, ADR-15
  Revision 4 — HOL-1293), how the confidential `quay` client and the
  `quay-oidc` secret bootstrap are wired, the two Keycloak realm superusers
  (`svc-quay-resource-controller`/`quay-admin`) and "Holos SSO" login +
  `SUPER_USERS` model, PKCE disabled for `quay` (HOL-1317 — Quay 3.17.3 replays
  a stale `code_verifier` after logout), grant/rotate/reconcile operations, and
  the `code exchange: 400` login-after-logout failure that motivated dropping
  PKCE. Companion to [ADR-15](docs/adr/ADR-15.md).
- [docs/runbooks/quay-resource-controller-credentials.md](docs/runbooks/quay-resource-controller-credentials.md)
  — the operator procedure for manually minting the Quay superuser
  OAuth-Application credential the shipped Holos Controller consumes: sign in
  via "Holos SSO" as `svc-quay-resource-controller` (password from its Secret),
  create a Quay OAuth Application, generate a scoped token, and store it as a
  Kubernetes Secret. Documents which org the Application is created under, the
  required scopes, and how to verify org-creation. Replaces the removed
  headless `quay-initial-admin` bootstrap. The token now lands as the
  `holos-controller-quay-creds` Secret (keys `url`/`token`/optional `username`)
  in the `holos-controller` namespace, which the shipped Holos Controller
  ([ADR-18](docs/adr/ADR-18.md)) reads via `credentialsSecretRef` to reconcile
  the `quay.holos.run` CRDs ([ADR-19](docs/adr/ADR-19.md)); the mint stays a
  manual step because the controller consumes (does not generate) this credential.
- [docs/runbooks/holos-controller.md](docs/runbooks/holos-controller.md) — the
  consumer-side runbook for the Holos Controller: the **AC #3** assumption that a
  single **superuser-account** OAuth-Application token authenticates all
  controller-managed Quay operations, and how to wire it — the
  `holos-controller-quay-creds` Secret (keys `url`/`token`/optional `username`)
  in the `holos-controller` namespace that each resource's `credentialsSecretRef`
  defaults to, created by `scripts/apply-svc-quay-resource-controller-creds`,
  resolved from the controller's own namespace via `POD_NAMESPACE`. Covers the
  isolated `controller-*` deploy targets, metrics verification, and the
  cluster-bring-up step — after `scripts/local-ca` and the manual credential
  mint, run `scripts/apply-projects` to provision the collection-driven projects
  (the `my-project` Namespaces + Organization, the per-project/app Keycloak CRs,
  carrying the local-ca `caBundle` the controller trusts the in-cluster Quay's
  serving cert with, instead of the pod's system trust store — see the
  [project/app templates guide](holos/docs/project-and-application-templates.md)).

  impersonate → forward, every replica answers Envoy), the
  `authenticator.holos.run` `Backend` CR (fields + in-cluster and external API
  server examples), the default `claims["groups"]` group mapping and CEL
  overrides, the **KSA / static-JWKS** backends (ADR-23 Rev 3 — `spec.oidc.jwks`
  offline validation, the SA-group CEL expression, the 1:1 host↔Backend model for
  remote clusters, and end-to-end ESO `SecretStore`/`ExternalSecret`
  verification), the **impersonation RBAC** the forwarded credential must hold
  (`impersonate` on `users`/`groups`), provisioning the `credentialsSecretRef`
  Secret at runtime (never committed), the Istio `extensionProvider` + `CUSTOM`
  `AuthorizationPolicy` wiring, the out-of-band apply ordering (CRD-before-CR;
  excluded from the bootstrap floor like `holos-controller`), and end-to-end
  verification. Companion to [ADR-23](docs/adr/ADR-23.md), the component README

  artifact, with the deterministic input-addressed tagging convention and
  required push credentials. Replaces the deferred in-cluster render
  subscriber. Also documents the **platform config bundle** (`scripts/publish-config`
  / `make config-build`/`config-push`): the committed `holos/deploy/` tree tarred
  as-is under the mutable `holos-paas-config:dev` tag, the **platform App-of-Apps**
  that consumes it (the `platform-bootstrap` root + per-component children, the
  sync-wave bootstrap ordering, the "Always" `:dev` re-pull mechanism), and how the
  separate `scripts/apply-platform-app-of-apps` wires the publish + root-Application
  apply as the post-Argo-CD bootstrap handoff — run after `scripts/apply` stops at
  the floor and the holos Quay org is configured (HOL-1373/HOL-1378/HOL-1379,

  (Guard Rails, above) — **binding guardrail**: every cross-namespace reference
  between `holos.run` custom resources MUST be authorized by a
  `security.holos.run` `ReferenceGrant` in the referent (target) namespace;
  an ungranted reference is rejected (`Ready=False`), never silently honored.
  See [ADR-22](docs/adr/ADR-22.md).
- [*Rich Gateway-API status reporting on all holos.run CRs*](#rich-gateway-api-status-reporting-on-all-holosrun-crs-adr-22-adr-19-adr-18)
  (Guard Rails, above) — **binding guardrail**: every `holos.run` CR reports a
  `status.conditions[]` slice of `metav1.Condition` (`+listType=map`,
  `+listMapKey=type`) with `Accepted`/`Programmed`/`Ready` types plus
  `status.observedGeneration` and a `Ready` printer column, the Quay/Gateway-API
  model. See [ADR-22](docs/adr/ADR-22.md), [ADR-19](docs/adr/ADR-19.md),
  [ADR-18](docs/adr/ADR-18.md).
- [*Keycloak service-account naming (`svc-` prefix)*](#conventions) (Conventions,
  below) — Keycloak realm users that represent service accounts are named with
  an `svc-` prefix (e.g. `svc-quay-resource-controller`); human accounts are
  not (e.g. `quay-admin`).

## Conventions

- Decisions live in ADRs; revise the existing ADR (and its revision table)
  rather than writing a new one for a refinement.
- Every platform capability is modeled as Kubernetes resources
  ([ADR-2](docs/adr/ADR-2.md)); integrations like Keycloak group membership
  and Quay self-service are CRDs with reconcilers, not imperative tools. The
  Keycloak OIDC clients (argocd, quay) are reconciled declaratively by the
  `keycloak-config` keycloak-config-cli Job; the conventional declarative-client
  pattern and the guardrails for adding another PKCE client are in
  [holos/docs/keycloak-clients.md](holos/docs/keycloak-clients.md).
- **Keycloak realm users that represent service accounts MUST be named with an
  `svc-` prefix** (e.g. `svc-quay-resource-controller` — the future Quay
  Resource Controller's machine identity) so they are unambiguously
  distinguishable from human users, which are **not** prefixed (e.g.
  `quay-admin`). The two superuser realm users seeded in HOL-1294 are the worked
  example: `svc-quay-resource-controller` (service account) and `quay-admin`
  (human). See `holos/components/keycloak/realm-config/buildplan.cue`.
- Deployment configuration and policy are CUE rendered with
  `holos render platform`; `scripts/render` renders and verifies the
  committed `holos/deploy/` tree is diff-clean.
- Go code lives in the single root module `github.com/holos-run/holos-paas`
  laid out per [ADR-12](docs/adr/ADR-12.md): the multi-service binary under
  `cmd/holos-paas/` (one subcommand per service) and all
  implementation under `internal/`. `make test` (gofmt, `go vet`, then the
  race-enabled test suite) is the entry point; the `Go` job in
  [.github/workflows/ci.yaml](.github/workflows/ci.yaml) runs it alongside
  `golangci-lint`.
- The CLI is built with **Fisk, not Cobra** ([ADR-17](docs/adr/ADR-17.md)) so
  commands, subcommands, and flags are self-documenting and legible to AI
  coding agents (`--help-llm`, `--fisk-introspect`, cheats). Add every command
  and flag with Fisk in `internal/cli`, following the `deploy` command as the
  template — see [docs/cli-guardrails.md](docs/cli-guardrails.md). Never
  reintroduce Cobra or `pflag`.
- Label and annotation keys owned by the platform configuration layer —
  aspects of the holos configuration itself, independent of site-specific
  configuration — default to the `holos.run` domain (e.g.
  `app.holos.run/component.name`). `materia.ai` keys must never appear in
  the holos configuration or Go code; the `Guardrails` job in
  [.github/workflows/ci.yaml](.github/workflows/ci.yaml) enforces this.
- Merge pull requests with a **squash merge** (`gh pr merge --squash`) —
  never a merge commit or a rebase merge — so code-review fix commits
  (e.g. `fix: address code review round 1 findings`) are squashed away.
  Clean up the squash commit message before merging: one
  conventional-commit subject and body describing the final change, with
  the review-round noise removed.
